# Getting Started with Juno

Unless you're looking to solely host your static website, the recommended way to start with Juno is by developing locally using the emulator — a production-like environment with full support for data, authentication, storage, and serverless functions.

It gives you everything you need to build and test your app before deploying anything live.

Here are a few solid places to go from here:

- 🚀 [Start a new project](./start-a-new-project.mdx) – Scaffold a brand new project with your favorite frontend framework.
- 🔌 [Set up the SDK](./setup-the-sdk.mdx) – Integrate Juno into an existing app.
- 🧪 [Run your project locally](./guides/local-development.mdx) – Use the emulator to build and test locally in an environment that mirrors production.
- 🛰️ [Deploy with a Satellite](./create-a-satellite.mdx) – When you're ready to go live, deploy your project to its own container.

## How It Works

Juno is your own self-contained execution space.

No DevOps. No backend boilerplate. No surprise complexity.

You build your frontend using the frameworks you love — React, SvelteKit, Next.js, you name it.

Need backend logic? Just drop in a serverless function written in Rust or TypeScript.

Everything gets bundled into a single deployable WebAssembly (WASM) container. One artifact. One push. That's your app. It runs in an unstoppable environment that holds its entire state — data, logic, and storage.

And here's the beauty of it: Juno controls nothing.

It has zero access to your code, data, or infrastructure. Everything runs under your ownership. Think of it as the space between self-hosting and the serverless cloud — a reimagined model for application development.

You manage your projects and supporting modules — themed around space mythology — using either a CLI or the Console UI, depending on your workflow.

To strengthen this principle of non-interference, deploys and upgrades can be handled via GitHub Actions if you choose to opt in — which themselves can't start or stop your app once it's live.

And during development, the environment mirrors production as closely as possible — so you're never caught by “but it worked locally.”
