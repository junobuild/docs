# Getting Started with Juno

Start your journey by [launching](./create-a-satellite.mdx) your first Satellite ‚Äì a feature-packed container for your project.

It gives you full control üîê over authentication, a key-pair datastore (akin to a simple 'database'), file storage, your own serverless functions, and hosting.

It‚Äôs everything you need to run your app. Zero DevOps, no external resources required.

---

## Integrating Juno into an Existing App

After creating your Satellite, you're ready to put it to use. Follow our [step-by-step guidance](setup-the-sdk) to install the SDK and initialize your app, connecting it to your container.

---

## Starting a brand new project

Are you starting a fresh project? We've got your back.

Whether it‚Äôs a website, blog, or app, leverage Juno's onboarding CLI to scaffold your project with ready-made templates for popular frontend frameworks like Astro, Next.js, React, SvelteKit, Vue, and Angular.

Just run:

import { Bash } from "./components/bash.mdx";

<Bash
  npm="npm create juno@latest"
  yarn="yarn create juno"
  pnpm="pnpm create juno"
/>

...and follow the prompts.

---

## Local development

Juno's tooling is designed for local-first development. Whether you're using the Next.js or Vite [plugins](reference/plugins.md), or creating a new app with `npm create juno@latest`, your project runs locally by default.

With the provided [emulator](./guides/local-development.md), you can build and test your projects in an environment that closely mirrors production, without the need to deploy live until you're ready.
