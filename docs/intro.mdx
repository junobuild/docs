# Getting Started

Start your Juno journey by launching your first **[Satellite](./create-a-satellite.mdx)** ‚Äì a feature-packed smart contract designed for your project.

A Satellite is your project‚Äôs all-in-one container, **giving you full control üîê** over authentication, a key-pair datastore (akin to a simple "database"), file storage, serverless functions, and hosting.

It‚Äôs everything you need to run your app ‚Äì no external resources required.

---

## Integrating Juno into an Existing App

After creating your Satellite, you're ready to put it to use. Follow our [step-by-step guidance](setup-the-sdk) to install the SDK and initialize your app, connecting it to your container.

---

## Starting a brand new project

Are you starting a fresh project? We've got your back.

Whether it‚Äôs a website, blog, or app, leverage Juno's onboarding CLI to scaffold your project with ready-made templates for popular frontend frameworks like Astro, Next.js, React, SvelteKit, Vue, and Angular.

Just run:

import { Bash } from "./components/bash.mdx";

<Bash
  npm="npm create juno@latest"
  yarn="yarn create juno"
  pnpm="pnpm create juno"
/>

...and follow the prompts.

:::note

Our CLI tool is compatible with Mac, Linux, and Windows and requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) to be installed. It also supports Yarn and pnpm.

## Local development

Want to develop locally before going live? Or just want to test out Juno in a non-production environment?

Use our [local development emulator](./guides/local-development.md) to build and test your projects in an environment that closely mirrors production, without needing to deploy live.

:::tip

The emulator comes with all starter templates. Just run `npm create juno@latest` to begin.
