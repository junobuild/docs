The amount of cycles available determines whether a module will be active, inactive, or eventually decommissioned (deleted).

This ensures that related costs cannot surpass the amount of cycles available.

Think of cycles like prepaid mobile data:

- Just like your mobile plan allows you to make calls and browse the internet, cycles enable your containers to process computations and store data.
- When your data (cycles) runs out, your service becomes inactive.
- To keep your modules running smoothly, you need to top up your cycles regularly (manually or automatically).
- If you don’t top it up, after some time, it will be decommissioned, similar to losing your prepaid number due to prolonged inactivity.
