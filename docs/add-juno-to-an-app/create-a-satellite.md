# Create a satellite

Before integrating Juno into your JavaScript app, you need to create a [satellite].

1. In the [Juno console](https://console.juno.build), click "Launch a new satellite".
2. Enter a name for your satellite (note: this is for display purposes only and does not need to be unique).
3. Click **Create a Satellite.**. Juno will automatically generate a unique ID for your new satellite.
4. The platform will then create your satellite smart contract and provision its resources.
5. Once the process is complete, click **Continue** to access the overview page.
