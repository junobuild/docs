# Business Model

Juno's business model is designed to provide value to developers while ensuring the sustainability and growth of the platform.

## Current Model

- **Freemium**: Juno operates on a freemium model, offering core features for free to help developers get started quickly and easily. Each new developer sign-up leads to two smart contracts they fully own: one for their wallet and one for their project or dApp.

- **Transaction-Based Fees**: Developers pay transaction fees for specific actions, such as spinning up additional new smart contracts.

## Future Plans

- **Subscription-Based Model**: To cater to the needs of more advanced users, Juno plans to introduce a pro plan which will offer enhanced functionality, including team collaboration and enhanced management tools.

- **Payment Transaction Fees**: A transaction fee might be introduced as part of the Payments SDK. This approach would enable the platform to generate revenue by charging a small fee on each transaction processed through its payment solutions.

In addition to the above costs, it is worth noting that developers are responsible for the operating costs associated with their smart contracts and projects. This ensures they have control over their expenses based on their specific usage and needs.

In shorter terms, Juno is a PaaS (Platform as a Service, derived from SaaS, Software as a Service), and its business model is akin to similar platforms in the cloud industry.
