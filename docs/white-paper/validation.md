# Validation and Metrics

I open sourced Juno's code on Valentine's Day 2023. After an invitation-based trial phase, it was officially launched to the public on April 20th, 2023. Over the last few months, there have been around 100 new Mission Controls created on a monthly basis, totaling 1,200 by the end of June 2024. In other words, we are assuming 100 new potential developers a month.

Due to its anonymity model and the current lack of specific metrics implementation, it is challenging to evaluate the conversion rate of developers who effectively develop and launch projects. However, a voluntary showcase is available on the website, and as detailed in the business model, additional satellites and analytics require a one-time transaction. By mid-July 2024, 169 of these paid smart contracts had been executed (see Juno's Console account address for reference). This, to some extension, validates both the demand for such services and the acceptance of a one-time fee model.

The Juno website itself uses Juno Analytics. On average this year, there have been over 4,000 monthly page views, 3,000+ unique page views, and 1,500+ unique sessions.
