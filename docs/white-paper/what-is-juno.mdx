# What is Juno?

Juno is a blockchain-as-a-service (“blockchainless”) platform that empowers developers to build decentralized apps efficiently. Similar to Web2 cloud service platforms but with significant improvements, it offers a comprehensive toolkit to scaffold secure and efficient projects running on the blockchain.

With Juno, developers can integrate features such as authentication, data and file storage, hosting, serverless functions, or on-chain analytics provided by smart contracts. This allows them to scaffold projects using familiar patterns while maintaining complete control over their work.

In short, Juno is the Google Firebase alternative for Web3.
