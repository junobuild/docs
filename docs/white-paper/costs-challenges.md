# Costs Challenges

While Junoâ€™s architecture and business model have been, to some extension, validated, it is important to acknowledge two cost-related challenges:

- **Cost of Acquisition**: The current cost of acquisition is relatively high, given that two smart contracts are spun up for each new developer.

- **Resource Management**: By automatically creating two smart contracts for new developers, the platform can be prone to attacks. To mitigate this, Juno uses a conservative approach by always having a limited amount of resources available for new developers, ensuring the resources remain under control. Similarly, there is a potential for developers with bad intentions to create new smart contracts and then move them to operate independently outside the platform straight from the start. If this becomes a concern, user experience improvements can be implemented to encourage greater commitment, helping to mitigate this risk.
