## License

Juno is released under the GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 (AGPLv3) or any later version. In addition, its source code shall not be used to create any similar Blockchain-as-a-Service offerings.

The libraries, CLI and other tools around the core features are released under MIT License.

## Audit Considerations

It is important to note that the codebase has not yet been audited. Currently, an audit may be seen as a complication and an investment that may not be fully justified given the current amount of funds held across the ecosystem. However, in the future, particularly after the development of the Mission Control wallet is complete (see chapter “Roadmap”), an audit will become valuable.
