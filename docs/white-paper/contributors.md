# Contributors

I developed and bootstrapped Juno. A few tasks, such as the design of the UI and logo, were outsourced to freelancers within my network.

I have been a freelance web developer since 2018. I hold an engineering degree in Computer Science and an Executive Master of Business Administration (EMBA). In addition to development, I have also served as a project manager and business analyst . Notably, I was previously the Vice Director at the leading company providing ERP solutions for the Swiss company registry.

In the future, I am committed to remaining the principal contributor to Juno, ensuring its continuous development and improvement.

In addition, as the DAO grows, the team will expand to include additional developers to achieve the ambitious goals outlined in the roadmap, as well as a developer evangelist to foster further growth and engagement.

That said, I am going to commit to the project only if the DAO succeeds. If it doesn't, Juno will enter maintenance mode, where I will stop developing new features and ultimately deprecate it.

I've been developing Juno as a side project for some time now and I feel like I've reached a crossroads where it either becomes a true initiative developed by a group of contributors, or I just find a new hobby. In addition, unlike building with Juno, developing Web3 without it requires significant energy. Therefore, sunsetting it would likely also mean that I might take a break from developing any personal projects for some time.

In short, to me, it's either Juno DAO or no Juno.
