# Legal Umbrella

To ensure Juno Build will operate within a legally sound framework, the DAO will be incorporated in the Marshall Islands. This jurisdiction offers an advanced legal environment specifically tailored to the needs of DAOs. Incorporating in the Marshall Islands will allow Juno Build to obtain corporate personhood, enabling the execution of business operations, signing of contracts and other off-chain activities.

This incorporation model will be strategically chosen to mitigate liability risks for projects and their investors. Under this structure, Juno Build DAO will be recognized as a DAO LLC, providing a legal buffer that will protect against personal liability. Importantly, this setup will support operational flexibility, recognizing blockchain operations and smart contract governance as legitimate under its laws.

Additionally, the Marshall Islands' legal framework will permit members holding less than a 25% share to maintain anonymity, eliminating the need for KYC procedures for these participants. This feature, combined with the legal recognition of smart contracts and DAO tokenomics, will provide Juno Build with the necessary legal infrastructure to support its innovative approach to product development, while maintaining legal compliance and operational efficiency.
