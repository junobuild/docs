# Outgoings

The DAO will have various financial outflows for covering Juno's smart contract costs (such as running cycles and onboarding new developers), potential third-party services usage, audit, core team and operational expenses through grant programs. Additionally, JUNOBUILD token may be employed to reward contributions through bounties.

We can expect those outgoings to be allocated as following:

**1. Developers** (60%): This portion will be dedicated to compensating the core developers and the developer evangelist ensuring achieving the goal of the roadmap while fostering growth as well.

**2. Marketing and Design** (15%): It will be allocated to engage consultants for various roles and tasks regarding marketing and design.

**3. Marketing and Community Building** (5%): A modest portion of costs will support ongoing marketing efforts. This includes events aimed at attracting more developers and users to the platform. The relatively low allocation reflects a preference for genuine engagement over traditional advertising.

**4. Operational Costs** (20%): This allocation will cover essential operational expenses, such as legal, accounting, and administrative costs.

While it is challenging to predict when the DAO will incur more incomings than outgoings, we ideally aim to achieve a break-even point within three years. Initially, the DAO will incur more outgoings than incomings.
