## SNS Swap

To promote decentralized governance and secure funding for the SNS, 30% of the total JUNOBUILD supply will be allocated for a swap. Participants in this SNS Swap, including the Neuron Fund, will receive their tokens as part of a diversified portfolio. This portfolio comprises five equal-value neurons, each with staggered dissolve delays of 0, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months, respectively. This structured approach ensures a balanced distribution and fosters long-term commitment among participants.

## Treasury

Following the successful completion of the SNS swap, the Juno Build SNS-DAO treasury will hold an estimated 500 million JUNOBUILD tokens alongside the ICP accumulated during the swap.

The deployment of any funds in the treasury will be strictly governed by DAO-approved proposals.

Subsequent to the SNS swap, the Juno contributors core team plans to propose the allocation of approximately 2% of the JUNOBUILD tokens and corresponding ICP tokens from the treasury to the DEXs, initiating the trading of the JUNOBUILD token.

## Team

I will receive tokens in the form of a basket of five equal-value neurons. These neurons will have different dissolve delays and vesting periods of one year or more.

Neurons with a “vesting period” remain untouchable until the designated period concludes, and no alteration can be made to the dissolve delay.

| Index | Stake     | Dissolve Delay | Vesting Period |
| ----- | --------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| 0     | 4,000,000 | 6 months       | 1 year         |
| 1     | 4,000,000 | 9 months       | 1.5 years      |
| 2     | 4,000,000 | 1 year         | 2 years        |
| 3     | 4,000,000 | 1.5 years      | 3 years        |
| 4     | 4,000,000 | 2 years        | 5 years        |
