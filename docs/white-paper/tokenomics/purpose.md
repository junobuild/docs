# Purpose of the Token

The Juno Build token will serve three purposes: governance, utility, and rewards.

## Governance

The governance token empowers developers and stakeholders to gain voting power by staking Juno Build tokens, which is a pivotal and central aspect of this project. As Juno operates as a blockchainless provider, it grants developers full control over their projects. This means that shipping new releases and providing services requires not only absolute trust but also complete transparency, the essence of Web3. Therefore, it is essential, in my opinion, that Juno becomes a DAO to ensure that what is built and delivered is validated by the community, developers and stakeholders, which is crucial for maintaining the trust, ensuring security, and quality.

## Utility Token

The Juno Build token will have multiple utilities within the ecosystem. These utilities will benefit both Juno and the developers:

For Juno:

1. **Transactions and Subscriptions:** The token can be used for payment of transactions and subscriptions for features provided by Juno, benefiting from a better price compared to transactions executed with other tokens.

2. **Swapping for Computation Power:** The token can be swapped to acquire computation power, effectively converting it to cycles or other infrastructure fees.

For Developers:

3. **Integrated Payments:** Developers will be able to integrate payment features into their projects and dApps, linked with their wallets on Juno (Mission Control). This allows developers to manage a single wallet that earns revenue.

4. **Clients Transactions:** Similar to payments, developers will also be able to earn for commissioned work or maintenance. For example, if a developer builds a dApp for a client, they can earn payments directly to their wallet on Juno.

5. **Marketplace Transactions:** The future marketplace for developers will enable them to offer features and services to others. These transactions will be conducted using the Juno Build token.

## Rewards

The Juno Build token will act as a reward mechanism. Those who hold staked tokens will be eligible to receive tokens as rewards on a regular basis.
