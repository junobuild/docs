# Target Audience

Juno is primarily designed for web developers. Whether those are individual programmers, small teams, or startups, the platform caters to those looking to transition from traditional Web2 development to the decentralized world of Web3 as well as those already familiar with Web3, regardless of their preferred blockchain.

Juno is ideal for developers aiming to build fully decentralized projects or decentralize parts of their current applications. Moreover, it is an excellent tool for those looking to bootstrap or develop a prototype rapidly.

While Juno does not currently target professionals within larger organizations directly, this can be envisioned for the future as Juno aims to support developers, any developers.
