# Conclusion

While I may be biased, I genuinely believe that Juno represents a significant step forward in the realm of decentralized development. I'm well aware that it does not yet cover all the features provided by Web2 services or the capabilities of standard Web3 solutions, but Juno's features and unique selling proposition are undeniably promising. Despite not having reached a significant market share yet, and with future scalability uncertain, Juno's potential is evident to me.

Establishing a DAO is an essential step that Juno should consider taking someday. Promoting full control for developers while retaining centralized ownership would be paradoxical. When the time comes, a DAO will ensure that Junoâ€™s growth, security, and transparency are upheld through community-driven governance.

I hope you enjoyed the read!

Live long and prosper,<br/>David
