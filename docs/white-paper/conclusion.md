# Conclusion

While I may be biased, I genuinely believe that Juno represents a significant step forward in the realm of decentralized development. I'm well aware that it does not yet cover all the features provided by Web2 services or the capabilities of standard Web3 solutions, but Juno's features and unique selling proposition are undeniably promising. Despite not having reached a significant market share yet, and with future scalability uncertain, Juno's potential is evident to me.

As for establishing a DAO, this step is crucial for continuing the journey. It would be paradoxical to promote full control for developers while keeping ownership of the ecosystem centralized. The DAO will ensure that Juno's growth, security, and transparency are maintained through community-driven governance.

I hope you enjoyed the read!

Live long and prosper,<br/>David
