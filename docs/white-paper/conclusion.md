# Conclusion

Juno represents a significant step forward in the realm of decentralized development. While it does not yet encompass all the features of Web2 services or the full capabilities of standard Web3 solutions, its unique selling proposition remains compelling. Market adoption is still in progress, and future scalability remains an open question, but the potential is evident.

Establishing a DAO is an essential consideration for the future. Full developer control cannot coexist with centralized ownership, making decentralized governance a necessary evolution. When the time comes, a DAO will ensure that growth, security, and transparency are upheld through community-driven decision-making.

Hope this was an insightful read!

Live long and prosper,<br/>David
