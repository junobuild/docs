# Problems Statement

While Web2 cloud providers like Google Firebase and other Web2 cloud solutions have revolutionized the development landscape, they come with several inherent limitations and challenges.

## 1. Centralization

Web2 cloud providers are inherently centralized, meaning that all data and services are controlled by a single entity. This centralization poses several problems:

- **Single Point of Failure**: Centralized systems are vulnerable to outages or failures. If the cloud provider experiences downtime, all applications and services relying on it are affected.

- **Censorship and Control**: Central authorities can impose restrictions, censor content, or control access to data and services, limiting the freedom and autonomy of users and developers.

## 2. Data Privacy and Security

Web2 cloud providers often handle vast amounts of personal and sensitive data, raising concerns about privacy and security:

- **Data Ownership**: Users and developers typically do not have full ownership and control over their data. The cloud provider retains significant control and can access or share data without user consent.

- **Security Risks**: Centralized storage of data makes it an attractive target for hackers. Breaches can result in massive data leaks, exposing sensitive information.

## 3. Limited Transparency

The operations of Web2 cloud providers are often opaque, leading to a lack of transparency in how data is handled and services are managed:

- **Proprietary Systems**: Many cloud providers use proprietary technologies and systems, making it difficult for developers to understand and trust the underlying mechanisms.

- **Unclear Policies**: Privacy policies and terms of service can be complex and difficult to understand, leading to uncertainty about how data is used and protected.

## 4. Cost

While Web2 cloud services can be cost-effective initially, they often lead to higher costs over time:

- **Escalating Costs**: As applications scale, the costs associated with using cloud services can increase significantly, impacting the sustainability of projects.
