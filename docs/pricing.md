## Operating costs

As the owner of your [mission control] or [satellites], you are responsible for their operating costs.

To ensure that your infrastructure usage is covered, you must maintain a minimum balance of [cycles](terminology.md#cycles).

You can top up your cycle balance in the Juno [console](https://console.build.com) using ICP from your [mission control] or from anywhere else on the [Internet Computer].

## Transaction costs

New developers joining Juno are given credits to create a [mission control] and their first [satellite].

To create additional satellites, a fee of 0.5 ICP is required, in addition to the costs required by the infrastructure to create the smart contract.

Please note that further transaction fees may be required in the future and prices and models are subject to change.

## Sending ICP to Your Mission Control

You can send ICP to your [mission control] from any cryptocurrency exchange platform (e.g., [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com), [Binance](binance.com/), etc.) or wallet (e.g. [NNS dapp](https://nns.ic0.app/)). To do so, you will need a destination address.

You can find this address in Juno's [console](https://console.juno.build/mission-control/). Once you are signed in, copy your **Account Identifier** from your personal mission control administration page.

:::info

You are the owner of your [mission control], and Juno has no control or access to it. Therefore, any [ICP](terminology.md#icp) transferred to your mission control belongs to you and only you.
