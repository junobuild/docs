# Roadmap

We have big plans for the near and distant future.

## Features

Our goal is to continue delivering features that seamlessly integrate both web3 and web2 worlds, while ensuring ease of development. This includes:

- Analytics
- Plug-and-play recurring payment and paywall solutions
- Handing over [mission control] or [satellite] to DAO SNS (Service Nervous Systems)

## Templates store

We aim to launch new features and more advanced templates in our satellites, such as "rockets" or "space stations.".

With unified interfaces, we envision a future where developers can create and sell their own smart contract templates and plugins, which can seamlessly integrate with their external services.

## Team collaboration

While Juno is currently focused on individual developers, we recognize the importance of collaboration and are planning to add team support.

## Infrastructure

To support growth and foster new ideas, we aim to make various infrastructure improvements, including:

- Upgrading satellites overall available memory, starting with 64 GB
- Enabling the implementation of backend functions in response to events triggered in satellites
- Replacing quick queries with certified calls by default
- Automatically topping up mission control and satellites
- Providing real-time data updates
- Server-side rendering
- End-to-end encryption using threshold key derivation

## Developer tooling

Easing the development process will always be a priority. To that end, we plan to provide:

- A local emulator suite for developers to build and test their apps
- Continuously updated documentation, along with sample repos and tutorials.
