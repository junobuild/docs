## Decentralized autonomous organization

While Juno is not yet a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), we aspire to transition towards this model in the near future. This will enable a transparent, democratic decision-making process, fostering a collaborative and adaptive ecosystem while also enhancing trust and security in the platform's operations and the implementation of upgrades.

---

## Features

Our goal is to continue delivering features that seamlessly integrate both web3 and web2 worlds, while ensuring ease of development. This includes:

- Analytics (Sept. 2023). âœ…
- Plug-and-play payment and paywall solutions.
- Application monitoring service.

---

## Marketplace for developers

We are committed to continually delivering new features related to the satellite or analytics smart contracts. While we may propose some new solutions in the future, our vision revolves around unified interfaces, enabling developers to design and offer their own smart contract solutions, templates, and plugins for other community developers.

In essence, while we may launch some of these features ourselves, let's refer to them as "rockets" or "space stations", establishing a marketplace will allow developers to contribute and profit from their work by offering their creations to fellow developers.

## Team collaboration

While Juno is currently focused on individual developers, we recognize the importance of collaboration and are planning to add team support.

---

## Infrastructure

To support growth and foster new ideas, we aim to make various infrastructure improvements, including:

- Adding additional authentication providers (Apr. 2023) âœ…
- Upgrading satellites overall available memory to maximum possible (Oct. 2023). âœ…
- Enhance hosting capabilities to offer Web2-like features (Nov. 2023). âœ…
- Blockchainless ("serverless") functions. Enabling the implementation of backend functions in response to events triggered within satellites. (Feb. 2024) âœ…
- Replacing queries with certified calls by default.
- Automatically topping up smart contracts.
- Server-side rendering.
- End-to-end encryption.

---

## Developer tooling

Easing the development process will always be a priority. To that end, we plan to provide:

- A local emulator for developers to build and test their apps (Jan. 2024). âœ…
- Allowing developers to easily scaffold new projects based on templates (April 2024). âœ…
- Continuously updated documentation, along with sample repos and tutorials.
