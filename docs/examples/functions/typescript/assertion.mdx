# TypeScript Assertion Example

This example demonstrates how to write a **custom assertion** in **TypeScript** for a Juno **serverless function**. It shows how to intercept and validate data operations—such as rejecting specific content—before it's written to the datastore.

The project includes a minimal frontend to help trigger and test the logic, but the primary focus is the backend assertion.

You can browse the source code here: [github.com/junobuild/examples/tree/main/functions/typescript/assertions](https://github.com/junobuild/examples/tree/main/functions/typescript/assertions)

## Key Features

- **Custom Assertions in TypeScript**: Demonstrates how to reject or validate data before it's saved, using TypeScript serverless functions.
- **Serverless Integration**: Runs as a Satellite function and integrates with Juno's datastore and authentication system.
- **Minimal UI for Testing**: A simple frontend is included to test and demonstrate the assertion logic in action.

---

## Main Backend Components

- **src/satellite/index.ts**: The core TypeScript logic for the Satellite serverless function. Implements the custom assertions (e.g., only allow certain valid inputs, etc.).
- **src/satellite/Cargo.toml**: TypeScript package configuration for the Satellite function.

## Example: Custom Assertion in TypeScript

Here’s the actual TypeScript logic from `index.ts`:

```typescript
import { type AssertSetDoc, defineAssert } from "@junobuild/functions";
import { decodeDocData } from "@junobuild/functions/sdk";
import { type NoteData, NoteDataSchema } from "../types/note";

export const assertSetDoc = defineAssert<AssertSetDoc>({
  collections: ["notes"],
  assert: (context) => {
    const note = decodeDocData<NoteData>(context.data.data.proposed.data);

    NoteDataSchema.parse(note);

    if (note.text.toLowerCase().includes("hello")) {
      console.log("❌ Rejected note containing 'hello':", note.text);
      throw new Error("The note should not contain the keyword 'hello'.");
    }
  }
});
```

**Explanation:**

- Defines a `NoteData` type and `NoteDataSchema` using [zod](https://zod.dev/) for runtime validation.
- Uses `defineAssert` to create a custom assertion for the `notes` collection.
- When a note is created or updated, the assertion checks if the note's text contains the word "hello" (case-insensitive).
- If it does, the note is rejected and an error is thrown; otherwise, the note is accepted.
- Prints a message to the log for both accepted and rejected notes.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/junobuild/examples
cd typescript/assertions
```

import HowToStart from "../../components/how-to-start.mdx";

<HowToStart index={2} />

import CreateSatellite from "../../components/create-a-satellite.mdx";

<CreateSatellite index={4} />

5. **Create required collections**:

- `notes` in Datastore: [http://localhost:5866/datastore](http://localhost:5866/datastore)
- `images` in Storage: [http://localhost:5866/storage](http://localhost:5866/storage)

import HowToRun from "../components/how-to-run.md";

<HowToRun />

---

import Config from "../components/config.md";

<Config />

---

import ProdDeploy from "../components/prod-deploy.md";

<ProdDeploy />

## Notes

- This example focuses on the TypeScript serverless function; the frontend is intentionally minimal and only included for demonstration purposes.
- Use this project as a starting point for writing custom assertions and backend logic in TypeScript with Juno.
