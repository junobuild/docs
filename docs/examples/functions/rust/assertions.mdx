# Rust Assertions Example

This example demonstrates how to write a **custom assertion** in **Rust** for a Juno **serverless function**. It shows how to intercept and validate data operations—such as rejecting specific content—before it's written to the datastore.

The project includes a minimal frontend to help trigger and test the logic, but the primary focus is the backend assertion.

## Key Features

- **Custom Assertions in Rust**: Demonstrates how to reject or validate data before it's saved, using Rust serverless functions.
- **Serverless Integration**: Runs as a Satellite function and integrates with Juno's datastore and authentication system.
- **Minimal UI for Testing**: A simple frontend is included to test and demonstrate the assertion logic in action.

---

## Main Backend Components

- **src/satellite/src/lib.rs**: The core Rust logic for the Satellite serverless function. Implements the custom assertions (e.g., only allow certain valid inputs, etc.).
- **src/satellite/Cargo.toml**: Rust package configuration for the Satellite function.

---

## Example: Custom Assertion in Rust

Here’s the actual Rust logic from `lib.rs`:

```rust
// This example defines a custom assertion in a Juno Satellite using Rust.
// It checks if a document being saved to the "notes" collection contains the word "hello".
// If it does, the assertion rejects the operation and logs a message.

use ic_cdk::print;
use junobuild_macros::assert_set_doc;
use junobuild_satellite::{include_satellite, AssertSetDocContext};
use junobuild_utils::decode_doc_data;
use serde::{Deserialize, Serialize};

#[derive(Serialize, Deserialize)]
struct Note {
    text: String,
    url: Option<String>,
}

#[assert_set_doc(collections = ["notes"])]
fn assert_set_doc(context: AssertSetDocContext) -> Result<(), String> {
    let note = decode_doc_data::<Note>(&context.data.data.proposed.data)?;

    if note.text.to_lowercase().contains("hello") {
        print(format!("❌ Rejected note containing 'hello': {}", note.text));
        return Err("The note should not contain the keyword 'hello'.".to_string());
    }

    print(format!("✅ Note accepted: {}", note.text));

    Ok(())
}

include_satellite!();
```

**Explanation:**

- Defines a `Note` struct with `text` and optional `url` fields. Similar as the fields used in the frontend.
- Uses the `#[assert_set_doc]` macro to create a custom assertion for the `notes` collection.
- When a note is created or updated, the assertion checks if the note's text contains the word "hello" (case-insensitive).
- If it does, the note is rejected and an error message is returned; otherwise, the note is accepted.
- Prints a message to the log for both accepted and rejected notes.
- `include_satellite!();` brings in the necessary boilerplate for the Juno Satellite runtime.

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repo**:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/junobuild/examples
cd rust/assertions
```

2. **Install dependencies**:

```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start Juno local emulator**:

:::important

Requires the Juno CLI to be available `npm i -g @junobuild/cli`

:::

```bash
juno dev start
```

4. **Create a Satellite** for local dev:

- Visit [http://localhost:5866](http://localhost:5866) and follow the instructions.
- Update `juno.config.ts` with your Satellite ID.

5. **Create required collections**:

- `notes` in Datastore: [http://localhost:5866/datastore](http://localhost:5866/datastore)
- `images` in Storage: [http://localhost:5866/storage](http://localhost:5866/storage)

6. **Start the frontend dev server** (in a separate terminal):

```bash
npm run dev
```

6. **Build the serverless functions** (in a separate terminal):

```bash
juno functions build
```

The emulator will automatically upgrade your Satellite and live reload the changes.

---

## Juno-Specific Configuration

- **juno.config.ts**: Defines Satellite IDs for development/production, build source, and predeploy steps. See the [Configuration reference](../../../reference/configuration.mdx) for details.
- **vite.config.ts**: Registers the `juno` plugin to inject environment variables automatically. See the [Vite Plugin reference](../../../reference/plugins.mdx#vite-plugin) for more information.

---

## Production Deployment

- Create a Satellite on the [Juno Console](https://console.juno.build) for mainnet.
- Update `juno.config.ts` with the production Satellite ID.
- Build and deploy the frontend:

```bash
npm run build
juno deploy
```

- Build and upgrade the serverless functions:

```bash
juno functions build
juno functions upgrade
```

---

## Notes

- This example focuses on the Rust serverless function; the frontend is intentionally minimal and only included for demonstration purposes.
- Use this project as a starting point for writing custom assertions and backend logic in Rust with Juno.

## Real-World Example

Want to see how assertions and serverless logic are used in a live project?

Check out [proposals.network](https://proposals.network), an open-source app built with Juno:

- GitHub: [github.com/peterpeterparker/proposals.network](https://github.com/peterpeterparker/proposals.network)
- Example logic: [src/satellite/src/lib.rs](https://github.com/peterpeterparker/proposals.network/blob/main/src/satellite/src/lib.rs)

This app uses:

- `#[on_delete_doc]` and `#[assert_delete_doc]` to validate and clean up related documents and assets
- Shared helper modules like `assert`, `delete`, and `types` to keep logic organized
- A real-world pattern of chaining asset/document deletions with assertions

It’s a great reference for more advanced setups and multi-collection coordination.
