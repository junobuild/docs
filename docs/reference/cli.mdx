# CLI

The Juno CLI provides a variety of tools for managing and deploying projects.

## Installing the Juno CLI

To download and install Juno CLI, run the following command:

```bash
npm i -g @junobuild/cli
```

---

## Administration

Commands dedicated to configuring and managing deployed Satellites, Mission Control, and other modules.

:::tip

The CLI automatically runs in non-interactive mode if either a `JUNO_TOKEN` is set or the `--headless` argument is used.

The former is set when you set up a [GitHub Actions](../guides/github-actions/index.mdx).

:::

---

### Login

import Login from "./cli/login.md";

:::important

Authenticating your terminal saves sensitive information on your device. We recommend setting up a password to encrypt this file when prompted.

:::

<Login />

The authentication process requires a browser.

#### Reusing Access Key

If you've previously authenticated your terminal and decide to log in again, the CLI will prompt you about reusing your existing access key.

This allows you to reuse your authorization, especially when creating new modules like satellites or orbiters.

#### Modes

The CLI supports multiple environment modes (`production`, `staging`, `development`, etc.).

Each mode requires its own login and identity for security reasons.
For example: `juno login --mode staging` or `juno login --mode development`.
If no mode is specified, it defaults to `production`.

#### How does it work?

A new [principal] is generated on your local machine and added as a administrator [access key](../miscellaneous/access-keys.md) of the selected modules. This principal is then used to authenticate any CLI calls made from your terminal to your satellites, mission controls or other modules.

The key is saved in the OS-specific user's variables path, for example:

| OS      | Path                                                                                                 |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mac     | `~/Library/Preferences/juno-nodejs`                                                                  |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\juno-nodejs\Config` (for example, `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\juno-nodejs\Config`) |
| Linux   | `~/.config/juno-nodejs` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/juno-nodejs`)                                          |

---

### Logout

:::caution

This action currently does not remove the controllers from satellites and/or mission control and/or orbiter. It only logs out your local machine by removing the locally saved key (principal).

:::

import Logout from "./cli/logout.md";

<Logout />

---

### Init

import Init from "./cli/init.md";

<Init />

The `juno init` command creates a `juno.config` file in the root directory of your project.

Depending on your project, it will either create a TypeScript, JavaScript, or JSON file.

:::tip

We recommend using the first two options because they can leverage your IDE's IntelliSense with type hints.

:::

This file is necessary for deploying, configuring, or running any other CLI commands for your app.

Read more about the [configuration](./configuration.mdx).

---

### Deploy

import Deploy from "./cli/deploy.md";

<Deploy />

---

### Config

import Config from "./cli/config.md";

<Config />

---

### Snapshot

import Snapshot from "./cli/snapshot.md";

<Snapshot />

---

### Stop

import Stop from "./cli/stop.md";

<Stop />

---

### Start

import Start from "./cli/start.md";

<Start />

---

### Clear

import Clear from "./cli/clear.md";

<Clear />

:::note

This command removes existing files from the satellite and only affects the app assets. The user's uploaded files will not be cleared as the app is deployed to a reserved collection, `#dapp`.

:::

---

### Upgrade

import Upgrade from "./cli/upgrade.md";

<Upgrade />

:::important

- We recommend that you stay current with the Juno releases, as some features may not perform correctly in the [console](../terminology.md#console) if your smart contracts are outdated.
- Upgrading requires a stable internet connection for a successful process.

:::

The CLI automatically runs in non-interactive mode if either a JUNO_TOKEN is set or the --headless argument is used.
