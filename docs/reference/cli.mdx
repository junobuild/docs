# CLI

The Juno CLI provides a variety of tools for managing and deploying projects.

## Installing the Juno CLI

To download and install Juno CLI, run the following command:

```bash
npm i -g @junobuild/cli
```

---

## Administration

Commands dedicated to configuring and managing deployed Satellites, Mission Control, and other modules.

:::tip

The CLI automatically runs in non-interactive mode if either a `JUNO_TOKEN` is set or the `--headless` argument is used.

The former is set when you set up a [GitHub Actions](../guides/github-actions/index.mdx).

:::

---

### Login

import Login from "./cli/login.md";

:::important

Authenticating your terminal saves sensitive information on your device. We recommend setting up a password to encrypt this file when prompted.

:::

<Login />

The authentication process requires a browser.

#### Reusing Access Key

If you've previously authenticated your terminal and decide to log in again, the CLI will prompt you about reusing your existing access key.

This allows you to reuse your authorization, especially when creating new modules like satellites or orbiters.

---

### Logout

:::caution

This action currently does not remove the controllers from satellites and/or mission control and/or orbiter. It only logs out your local machine by removing the locally saved key (principal).

:::

import Logout from "./cli/logout.md";

<Logout />

---

### Init

import Init from "./cli/init.md";

<Init />

The `juno init` command creates a `juno.config` file in the root directory of your project.

Depending on your project, it will either create a TypeScript, JavaScript, or JSON file.

:::tip

We recommend using the first two options because they can leverage your IDE's IntelliSense with type hints.

:::

This file is necessary for deploying, configuring, or running any other CLI commands for your app.

Read more about the [configuration](./configuration.mdx).

---

### Deploy

import Deploy from "./cli/deploy.md";

<Deploy />

---

### Config

import Config from "./cli/config.md";

<Config />

---

### Snapshot

import Snapshot from "./cli/snapshot.md";

<Snapshot />

---

### Stop

import Stop from "./cli/stop.md";

<Stop />

---

### Start

import Start from "./cli/start.md";

<Start />

---

### Clear

import Clear from "./cli/clear.md";

<Clear />

:::note

This command removes existing files from the satellite and only affects the app assets. The user's uploaded files will not be cleared as the app is deployed to a reserved collection, `#dapp`.

:::

---

### Upgrade

import Upgrade from "./cli/upgrade.md";

<Upgrade />

:::important

- We recommend that you stay current with the Juno releases, as some features may not perform correctly in the [console](../terminology.md#console) if your modules are outdated.
- Upgrading requires a stable internet connection for a successful process.

:::

The CLI automatically runs in non-interactive mode if either a JUNO_TOKEN is set or the --headless argument is used.

---

## Environment

Some CLI flags affect the context of your commands, such as which environment you're working in or which identity you're using. These flags are global and apply to most commands.

---

### Mode

The `--mode` flag lets you target a specific environment when executing CLI commands. This is useful for working across development, staging, and production setups.

```bash
juno login --mode development
juno deploy --mode staging
```

The value for `--mode` can be any string. If omitted, it defaults to production.

:::important

The `development` value is reserved. When you use `--mode development`, the tooling automatically understands that you are working with the local emulator.

:::

---

### Profile

The optional `--profile` flag lets you switch between different identities. Useful when working with multiple Mission Controls.

```bash
juno login --profile team
juno deploy --profile team --mode staging
```

It accepts any string. If omitted, no profile is used.

---

### Local Persistence

Unless you run it in headless mode with a token, the Juno CLI stores data locally in the following OS-specific user's variables path to work properly.

| OS      | Path                                                                                                 |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mac     | `~/Library/Preferences/juno-nodejs`                                                                  |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\juno-nodejs\Config` (for example, `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\juno-nodejs\Config`) |
| Linux   | `~/.config/juno-nodejs` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/juno-nodejs`)                                          |

These config files are created based on the selected `--profile` and `--mode`:

| File                                 | Encrypted | Purpose                                                                                               |
| ------------------------------------ | --------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `juno[-profile][-mode]`              | âœ…        | Stores the [access key](../miscellaneous/access-keys.md) ([principal]) and list of modules.           |
| `juno[-profile][-mode]-cli-settings` |           | Stores CLI preferences, e.g. whether the access key file is encrypted (to avoid unnecessary prompts). |
| `juno[-profile][-mode]-cli-state`    |           | Stores ephemeral state like applied config hashes.                                                    |
