# Infrastructure

In the local environment, several modules (also known as "canisters" on the Internet Computer) are automatically spun up. This ensures that developers have everything they need to start building right out of the box. Thanks to built-in plugins and tooling, these modules are automatically integrated into the environment, eliminating the need for devs to manually manage their bindings.

However, in some cases, it may be useful to explicitly reference module IDs. Below is a list of the modules and their respective IDs that are automatically mounted.

| Module                                                                                           | ID                            |
