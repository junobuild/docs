# Configuration

When the `juno` command is run from your terminal or used in a CI environment, it will automatically attempt to locate a config file named `juno.config.ts` or `juno.config.js` or `juno.config.json` within your project's root directory.

The Juno config file defines the settings and options needed for managing and deploying your satellites and other project modules, ensuring consistency across environments.

A basic config file looks like this:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    id: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai",
    source: "build"
  },
  orbiter: {
    id: "eeeee-fffff-ddddd-11111-cai"
  }
});
```

At the top level, the Juno configuration includes two main sections:

1. `satellite` (required): This defines the behavior of your satellite.
2. `orbiter` (optional): This is useful to automatically map your analytics in your application.

:::important

To apply any changes you make in your configuration, execute the [juno config](./cli.mdx#config) command with the CLI.

## Satellite Configuration

Satellites are the core component of your application in Juno. The satellite configuration defines how the satellite operates, including its identifier, datastore, storage, authentication, and more. This configuration is crucial for managing the satellite’s behavior and deploying it across different environments.

The satellite configuration is defined in your Juno configuration file. Below is a detailed explanation of how to configure it.

### ID or IDs

Each satellite must be uniquely identified using either:

- `id`: A single identifier for the satellite.
- `ids`: A mapping of identifiers for multiple environments, such as staging or production.

You can use one of these options but not both simultaneously. See the [Environments - Multiple Satellites](#environments---multiple-satellites) chapter below for details on setting up multiple ids.

import Plugins from "./components/plugins.mdx";

<Plugins />

### Source

import Source from "../build/components/source.mdx";

<Source />

### Ignore files

import IgnoreFiles from "../build/components/ignore-files.mdx";

<IgnoreFiles />

### GZIP

import Gzip from "../build/components/gzip.mdx";

<Gzip />

### Encoding

import Encoding from "../build/components/encoding.mdx";

<Encoding />

### Predeploy

The predeploy option allows you to define a list of scripts or commands to be executed before the deployment process begins. This is particularly useful for automating tasks such as:

- Compiling assets.
- Running tests or linters.
- Preparing production-ready files.

These scripts are executed sequentially in the order they are listed.

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    id: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai",
    source: "dist",
    predeploy: ["npm run build", "npm run lint"]
  }
});
```

### Postdeploy

The postdeploy option allows you to define a list of scripts or commands to be executed after the deployment process completes. This can be used for various follow-up tasks, such as:

- Sending notifications or alerts to administrators.
- Cleaning up temporary files.
- Logging deployment information for auditing.

Like `predeploy`, these scripts are executed sequentially in the order they are listed.

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    id: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai",
    source: "dist",
    postdeploy: ["./scripts/notify-admins.sh", "echo 'Deployment complete'"]
  }
});
```

### Storage

The `storage` configuration accepts the following options and parameters:

#### HTTP Headers

import HttpHeaders from "../build/components/http-headers.mdx";

<HttpHeaders />

#### Rewrites

import Rewrites from "../build/components/rewrites.mdx";

<Rewrites />

#### Redirects

import Redirects from "../build/components/redirects.mdx";

<Redirects />

#### iframe

import IFrame from "../build/components/iframe.mdx";

<IFrame />

#### Maximum Memory Size

You can configure optional limits on heap and stable memory for your smart contract to control the creation and update of assets in your storage.

When the limit is reached, the Storage and smart contract will continue to operate normally but will reject the upload of new assets.

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    id: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai",
    source: "dist",
    storage: {
      maxMemorySize: {
        stable: 1_073_741_824n // For example max. 1 GiB in bytes of Stable memory
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Datastore

The `datastore` configuration accepts the following options and parameters:

#### Maximum Memory Size

You can configure optional limits on heap and stable memory for your smart contract to control the creation and update of documentations in your Datastore.

When the limit is reached, the Datastore and smart contract will continue to operate normally but will reject changes to documents.

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    id: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai",
    source: "dist",
    datastore: {
      maxMemorySize: {
        stable: 1_073_741_824n // For example max. 1 GiB in bytes of Stable memory
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Authentication

The `authentication` configuration accepts the following options and parameters:

#### Derivation origin

The behavior of Internet Identity can be customized to ensure that users are recognized consistently across different domains or subdomains of your application.

For example, if you set `derivationOrigin` to "hello.com", a user signing in at https://hello.com will receive the same identifier (principal) as when signing in at https://www.hello.com.

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    id: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai",
    authentication: {
      internetIdentity: {
        derivationOrigin: "hello.com"
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Assertions

import Assertions from "../build/components/assertions.mdx";

<Assertions />

### Settings

The `settings` field allows you to configure various aspects of the module’s behavior and resource usage, such as memory limits, compute allocation, and log visibility.

Overview:

- **Freezing Threshold**: Prevents the module from being deleted by pausing operations when cycles drop below a certain level.
- **Reserved Cycles Limit**: Ensures a minimum number of cycles are available for future operations.
- **Log Visibility**: Controls who can access the module’s logs.
- **Heap Memory Limit**: Sets the hard maximum heap memory available to the module.
- **Memory Allocation**: Pre-allocates memory for optimized performance.
- **Compute Allocation**: Reserves a percentage of the subnet’s compute resources.

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    id: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai",
    settings: {
      freezingThreshold: 2_592_000n,
      reservedCyclesLimit: 5_000_000_000_000n,
      logVisibility: "controllers",
      heapMemoryLimit: 2048n,
      memoryAllocation: 1_073_741_824n,
      computeAllocation: 50n
    }
  }
});
```

For a complete explanation of all [settings](./settings.md), including detailed examples and calculations, see the Settings section.

## Orbiter Configuration

Orbiters are an optional component of your application used for analytics.

### ID

An orbiter has a unique identifier (id). This ID is used to reference the orbiter during operations and deployments.

<Plugins />

---

## Emulator Configuration

For local development or when running an E2E test environment in a CI, you'll use the emulator. When running `juno dev start`, it defaults to booting Skylab with the default options. If you wish to tweak options or use another image, you can set the `emulator` field in your configuration file.

A basic example of a custom emulator configuration:

```ts title="juno.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    id: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai",
    source: "dist"
  },
  emulator: {
    runner: {
      type: "docker",
      image: "junobuild/skylab:latest",
      name: "juno-skylab",
      volume: "juno",
      platform: "linux/amd64"
    },
    skylab: {
      ports: {
        server: 5987,
        admin: 5999,
        console: 5866
      }
    }
  }
});
```

### Runner Options

The `runner` field allows you to customize how the emulator container is run.

| Option   | Required | Description                                                               | Default                                                                  |
| -------- | -------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| type     | ✅       | Container runtime used. Supports `docker` and `podman`.                   | `docker`                                                                 |
| image    |          | The image used to start the emulator.                                     | `junobuild/skylab:latest`                                                |
| name     |          | Custom name for the container instance.                                   | Derived from your `package.json` field `name` or falling on `juno-image` |
| volume   |          | A volume used to persist internal state - saves the data across sessions. | The container name adapted (replace `-` by `_`)                          |
| target   |          | Shared folder for deploying and hot-reloading serverless functions.       | `$PWD/target/deploy`                                                     |
| platform |          | Platform to run the emulator on (`linux/amd64` or `linux/arm64`).         | Automatic                                                                |

:::note

When defining a `runner`, you must also set the corresponding image configuration (`skylab`, `satellite`, or `console`), which can be left empty. This ensures the emulator knows which component to launch.

:::

#### Example using Podman

If you're using Podman instead of Docker, you can specify it with the `type` field:

```ts title="juno.config.ts"
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    id: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai",
    source: "dist"
  },
  emulator: {
    runner: {
      type: "podman"
    },
    skylab: {}
  }
});
```

This will use the default image and settings, but with Podman as the container runtime. You can customize the image, volume, and other options just like you would with Docker.

### Emulator

You can choose from three emulator types, depending on which part of the stack you want to run locally:

- `skylab`: A full emulator stack including the Console UI.
- `console`: A minimal emulator for Console-only scenarios.
- `satellite`: Runs just a Satellite container for focused development.

Each type has its own `ports` configuration.

#### Ports

You can customize the ports exposed by the emulator:

| Field   | Description                                                                      | Default |
| ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------- |
| server  | The local Internet Computer replica port. Your app or project interacts with it. | `5987`  |
| admin   | Admin server used for internal tasks (e.g., ICP transfer).                       | `5999`  |
| console | Console UI port (only used with `skylab`).                                       | `5866`  |

---

## Apply Changes

Configurations such as above [storage](#storage), [datastore](#datastore), [authentication](#authentication), and [settings](#settings) require explicit application to your smart contract as they directly impact its behavior.

To apply your changes, run the [juno config](./cli#config) command in the CLI after modifying your configuration file.

---

## Intellisense

To enable intellisense in your IDE for TypeScript or JavaScript configurations, you will need to install the necessary types:

```bash
npm install @junobuild/config --save-dev
```

Afterwards, you can leverage your IDE's intellisense with jsdoc type hints:

```javascript title="juno.config.js"
/** @type {import('@junobuild/config').JunoConfig} */
export default {
  // ...
};
```

Alternatively, you can use the `defineConfig` helper which should provide intellisense without the need for jsdoc annotations:

```javascript title="juno.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
});
```

---

## Conditional Config

If the config needs to conditionally determine options based the `mode` being used, it can export a function instead:

```javascript title="juno.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => ({
  satellite: {
    id: "aaaaa-bbbbb-ccccc-ddddd-cai",
    source: "dist",
    storage: {
      ...(mode === "staging" && { iframe: "allow-any" })
    },
    predeploy: [`npm run build -- --mode ${mode}`]
  }
}));
```

---

## Modes

By default, the CLI runs command for the `production` mode.

This means when running a `juno` command in your terminal, it will pass the mode `production` to read your configuration.

You can overwrite the default mode used for a command by passing the `--mode` option flag. For example, if you want to deploy your app for a `staging` mode:

```bash
juno deploy --mode staging
```

---

## Environments - Multiple satellites

You might want to deploy or manage a similar project across different environments. Using [modes](#modes), you can deploy the same application on multiple satellites, such as staging and production environments.

To accommodate different satellite IDs, you can use a [conditional config](#conditional-config):

```javascript title="juno.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => ({
  satellite: {
    id:
      mode === "staging"
        ? "11111-22222-33333-44444-cai"
        : "aaaaa-bbbbb-ccccc-ddddd-cai",
    source: "dist"
  }
}));
```

Or explicitly list the IDs:

```javascript title="juno.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    ids: {
      staging: "11111-22222-33333-44444-cai",
      production: "aaaaa-bbbbb-ccccc-ddddd-cai"
    },
    source: "dist"
  }
});
```

The latter method is also compatible with JSON configuration:

```json title="juno.config.json"
{
  "satellite": {
    "ids": {
      "staging": "11111-22222-33333-44444-cai",
      "production": "aaaaa-bbbbb-ccccc-ddddd-cai"
    },
    "source": "dist"
  }
}
```

Note that defining an `id` or at least a `production` entry in `ids` is mandatory.
