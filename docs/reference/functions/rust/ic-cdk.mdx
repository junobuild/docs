<IcCdk />

In the context of Juno, it enables your Satellite to perform low-level operations such as logging, accessing your Satellite identities, or communicating with other canisters â€” all essential when writing advanced serverless functions.

**All features** of the IC CDK are supported in Juno Satellites.

Because of this compatibility, we do not list them individually here and encourage you to consult the official documentation instead.

ðŸ“¦ See full documentation on [docs.rs/ic-cdk](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk/latest/ic_cdk/)

:::note

For compatibility, always use the `ic_cdk` version specified in Junoâ€™s release notes. This ensures proper integration and avoids version mismatch issues.
