## Datastore

The following functions can be used to manage documents within the Datastore from your serverless functions.

### set_doc_store

Sets a document in a collectionâ€™s of the datastore. Use this to insert or update document data.

```rust
pub fn set_doc_store(
    caller: UserId,
    collection: CollectionKey,
    key: Key,
    value: SetDoc,
) -> Result<DocContext<DocUpsert>, String>
```

## Others

The SDK also provides various Satellite-specific functions

### random

Generates a random `i32`.

:::caution

The generator is seeded once after upgrade of the Satellite. This makes it unsuitable for use cases requiring unpredictable randomness, like lotteries.

:::

```rust
pub fn random() -> Result<i32, String>
```
