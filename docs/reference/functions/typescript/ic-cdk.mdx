# IC-CDK

import IcCdk from "../components/ic-cdk.md";

<IcCdk />

Juno exposes a growing set of these features for TypeScript, allowing you to build serverless functions that interact with the IC using a familiar developer experience.

These features are made available through a layer that acts as a proxy between the Rust-based IC-CDK and JavaScript.

:::note[ðŸ“¦ Library]

The IC-CDK for JS/TS is provided by the [@junobuild/functions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@junobuild/functions) library.

To add it to your project:

import { Bash } from "../../../components/bash.mdx";

<Bash
  npm="npm i @junobuild/functions"
  yarn="yarn add @junobuild/functions"
  pnpm="pnpm add @junobuild/functions"
/>

You have to follow the pace of the Juno release to ensure compatibility. Refer to the [maintenance guide](../../../build/functions/development/typescript.mdx#maintenance) for instructions.

## id

Retrieves the Principal ID of the current Satellite.

This is useful when you want to use functions such as [setDocStore](./sdk.mdx#setDocStore) with the caller set as the administrator. Since the code is running on the backend side (inside the container), the Satellite itself is considered the caller and has admin-level permissions.

```typescript
function id(): Principal;
```

ðŸ“¦ Import from `@junobuild/functions/ic-cdk`

#### Returns:

- `Principal`: The Principal ID of the currently executing Satellite.

#### Notes:

- This function is a JavaScript binding for the Rust function [ic_cdk::id()](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk/latest/ic_cdk/fn.id.html).

## call

Makes an asynchronous call to a canister on the Internet Computer.

Use this function inside your serverless functions to interact with other canisters. It encodes arguments using Candid, performs the call, and decodes the response based on the expected result type.

```typescript
function call<T>(params: CallParams): Promise<T | undefined>;
```

ðŸ“¦ Import from `@junobuild/functions/ic-cdk`

#### Parameters:

- `params`: The parameters required to make the canister call.
  - `canisterId`: The target canister's ID.
  - `method`: The name of the method to call. Must be at least one character long.
  - `args` (optional): An array of tuples containing each argumentâ€™s Candid type and its corresponding value.
  - `result` (optional): The expected result type used for decoding the response.

#### Returns:

- A promise resolving to the decoded result of the call. If the canister returns no value, `undefined` is returned.

#### Notes:

- This function is a JavaScript binding for the Rust function [ic_cdk::call()](https://docs.rs/ic-cdk/latest/ic_cdk/api/call/fn.call.html).
