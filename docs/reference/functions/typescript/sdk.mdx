# SDK

The following functions are provided to help you work with document and asset data inside your Satellite. They are part of the tools available when writing serverless functions in Rust and support common tasks such as interacting with the datastore, storage, and custom hook logic.

:::note[ðŸ“¦ Library]

The SDK is provided by the [@junobuild/functions](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@junobuild/functions) library.

To add it to your project:

import { Bash } from "../../../components/bash.mdx";

<Bash
  npm="npm i @junobuild/functions"
  yarn="yarn add @junobuild/functions"
  pnpm="pnpm add @junobuild/functions"
/>

You have to follow the pace of the Juno release to ensure compatibility. Refer to the [maintenance guide](../../../build/functions/development/typescript.mdx#maintenance) for instructions.
