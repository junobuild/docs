# What makes Juno a great Vercel alternative

Vercel has been a default choice for frontend teams building with Next.js. It's fast, convenient, and delivers a world-class developer experience. For teams prioritizing raw speed and integration with the centralized cloud ecosystem, Vercel is the established leader.

But what if you need more than just speed? What if you need true ownership, control over your infrastructure, and a platform that won't lock you in?

This is where Juno steps in. It's an open-source, next-gen serverless platform to build, deploy, and run modern apps with the privacy and control of self-hosting — without the infrastructure headache.

---

## The Trade-Off: Convenience vs. Control

Vercel's strength lies in its managed infrastructure. It handles everything, but that convenience comes at a cost: your application is entirely dependent on their commercial policies and centralized infrastructure.

Juno flips this model. It provides a similar seamless developer experience but gives you your own self-contained execution space. This architectural difference is the key benefit for developers:

- **Your Own Infrastructure**: Your application runs in a container you own and control — with zero DevOps burden. Juno has zero access to your code, data, or infrastructure. Everything runs under your ownership.
- **Unstoppable Execution**: Deployed to a network of independent nodes operated by different providers worldwide, making it resistant to censorship, unexpected downtime, and single points of failure.

## Feature Breakdown: Vercel's Speed vs. Juno's Stack

| Feature              | Vercel (Centralized Speed)                | Juno (Decentralized Control)                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Deployment           | Global CDN (Centralized Cloud)            | Decentralized Containers (Unstoppable)           |
| Serverless Functions | Edge Functions (Fast, Centralized)        | Rust/TypeScript Functions (Owned, Decentralized) |
| Authentication       | External Services Required                | Built-in Decentralized Auth (Privacy-First)      |
| Datastore            | External Services Required                | Built-in Decentralized Datastore (Owned Data)    |
| File Storage         | External Services Required                | Built-in Decentralized Storage                   |
| Core Benefit         | Speed, Convenience, Established Ecosystem | Ownership, Privacy, Integrated Full Stack        |

## Cost Advantage: Predictable Ownership vs. Escalating Bills

Vercel offers a generous free tier — but its pricing scales quickly and often unpredictably as your traffic grows. Bandwidth overages and function execution costs can lead to surprise bills as your application succeeds.

Juno offers predictable, usage-based pricing with transparent costs for compute and storage. You pay for what you use like a utility, with no surprise bandwidth charges or vendor lock-in premiums. This creates cost efficiency and financial stability for growing apps.

---

## Beyond Hosting: A Full-Stack Advantage

Vercel excels at frontend deployment, but often requires you to stitch together external services for a complete application — databases, file storage, functions, and more.

Juno integrates these natively:

- **Built-in Data & Storage** — Store app state and user-generated content without managing external services.
- **Serverless Functions** — Write backend logic in Rust or TypeScript and deploy alongside your frontend.
- **Familiar Developer Workflow** — Works with React, Next.js (static export), SvelteKit (static), Astro, Vue, and more.

The result: modern serverless development in your own self-contained execution space — the privacy and control of self-hosting without the operational overhead.

## Performance Considerations

Juno's decentralized network is optimized for web-speed delivery with nodes distributed globally. While Vercel's edge network is highly optimized for raw speed, Juno delivers competitive performance with the added benefit of resilience and data sovereignty.

For applications where sub-50ms response times are critical (like real-time collaborative tools), Vercel's edge infrastructure may have an advantage. For most web applications, Juno provides excellent performance while giving you full ownership of your stack.

---

## What You Should Know

Juno represents a different approach to web infrastructure. Here's what to consider:

**Best fit for:**

- Projects requiring data sovereignty and user-owned data
- Privacy-focused applications where you don't want to depend on centralized providers
- Long-term projects where you want infrastructure independence
- Applications needing censorship resistance or unstoppable availability

**Trade-offs to consider:**

- Smaller (but growing) ecosystem compared to Vercel's mature marketplace
- No server-side rendering (SSR) support — Juno is optimized for static sites and client-side applications

**Migration path:**

Juno supports standard web frameworks, making it straightforward to port existing applications. Many teams start with a proof of concept to explore the platform — getting started is free, so you can experiment without commitment before deciding to migrate.

## The Right Choice for Your Project

If you're building a simple marketing site and need maximum speed with a large ecosystem of integrations, Vercel remains a strong choice.

But if your application demands:

- **Your own infrastructure** without DevOps overhead
- **Full-stack services you control** (auth, data, storage, compute)
- **Privacy and ownership** — Juno has zero access to your code or data
- **Open-source, unstoppable execution**

Then **Juno is a powerful Vercel alternative** — the same serverless experience developers love, with actual ownership and control over your application.
