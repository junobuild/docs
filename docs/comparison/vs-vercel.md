# What makes Juno a great Vercel alternative

Vercel defined modern frontend deployment. It's fast, convenient, and delivers a world-class developer experience. For teams prioritizing raw speed and integration with the centralized cloud ecosystem, Vercel is the established leader.

But what if you need more than just speed? What if you need true ownership, control over your infrastructure, and a platform that won't lock you in?

This is where Juno steps in. As an open-source, next-generation serverless platform, Juno is a powerful Vercel alternative that gives you the convenience of serverless deployment with the control of self-hosting. It's built for developers who want to escape the limits of the centralized cloud.

## The Trade-Off: Convenience vs. Control

Vercel's strength lies in its managed infrastructure. It handles everything, but that convenience comes at a cost: your application is entirely dependent on their commercial policies and centralized infrastructure.

Juno flips this model. It provides a similar seamless developer experience but runs on a decentralized serverless platform. This architectural difference is the key benefit for developers:

- **Unstoppable Infrastructure**: Your application is deployed to a network of independent nodes, making it resistant to censorship, unexpected downtime, and single points of failure.
- **True Ownership**: Your application and data are deployed to a public, open network that you control — the ultimate form of self-hosting without the DevOps burden.

## Feature Breakdown: Vercel's Speed vs. Juno's Stack

| Feature | Vercel (Centralized Speed) | Juno (Decentralized Control) |
|---|---|---|
| Deployment | Global CDN (Centralized Cloud) | Decentralized Canisters (Unstoppable) |
| Serverless Functions | Edge Functions (Fast, Centralized) | Rust/TypeScript Functions (Owned, Decentralized) |
| Authentication | External Services Required | Built-in Decentralized Auth (Privacy-First) |
| Datastore | External Services Required | Built-in Decentralized Datastore (Owned Data) |
| Core Benefit | Speed, Convenience, Established Ecosystem | Ownership, Privacy, Integrated Full Stack |

## Cost Advantage: Predictable Ownership vs. Escalating Bills

Vercel offers a generous free tier — but its pricing scales quickly and often unpredictably as your traffic grows.

Juno, by contrast, offers predictable, long-term cost control. You pay for compute and storage like a utility, with transparent usage-based pricing. This creates cost efficiency and financial stability for growing apps — a core benefit of true ownership.

---

## Beyond Hosting: A Full-Stack Advantage

Vercel often requires you to stitch together external services for a complete app (auth, database, storage).

Juno integrates these natively:

- **Integrated Authentication** — Privacy-first, decentralized identity layer, no third-party auth needed.
- **Built-in Data & Storage** — Unified datastore and storage for a complete application backend.
- **Familiar Developer Workflow** — Works with your favorite frontend frameworks and deploys via:

```bash
npm create juno@latest
```

The result: modern serverless development with a self-hosted architecture — without the operational overhead.

## The Right Choice for Your Project

If you’re building a simple marketing site and need maximum speed with a large ecosystem, Vercel remains a strong choice.

But if your application demands:

- **True self-hosting** without DevOps overhead
- **Owned full-stack services** (auth, data, compute)
- **Predictable, cost-controlled infrastructure**
- **Open-source, unstoppable hosting**

Then **Juno is the definitive Vercel alternative** — the same serverless experience developers love, with actual ownership and control over your application.
