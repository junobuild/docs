# What makes Juno a great Netlify alternative

Netlify has long been a go-to platform for frontend developers. It pioneered the Jamstack movement, offers smooth Git-based workflows, and makes shipping static sites fast and simple.

But as projects mature, needs evolve. Ownership starts to matter. Data and infrastructure control matter. Cost predictability matters. And having the freedom to run your application independently becomes increasingly important.

This is where Juno steps in. Juno provides the same simple deployment experience for static sites — but runs your project in a container you own, with full control over its execution. It's the convenience of managed infrastructure with the control of self-hosting.

---

## The Trade-Off: Convenience vs Control

Netlify's strength is its fully managed, centralized hosting. It handles everything, which is great — until you need:

- Guarantees around application independence
- Confidence your project can't be taken offline by a provider
- Predictable long-term pricing
- Ownership over your data and runtime

Juno flips the model. You get the same simple “git push to deploy” flow, but you run your app in your own execution environment — without managing servers or ops.

- **Your Own Hosting Container** — Your site runs in a container you own and control. No black-box environment.
- **Unstoppable Delivery** — Hosted across independent nodes. No single provider can restrict or remove your project.

Same simplicity — more control.

## Feature Breakdown: Netlify's Jamstack vs Juno's Stack

| Feature        | Netlify (Managed Jamstack)     | Juno (Owned Execution)                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Deployment     | Global CDN (Centralized)       | Decentralized Containers (User-owned)        |
| Static Hosting | Yes — fast and convenient      | Yes — same simplicity, but with ownership    |
| Functions      | Lambda-based (Optional Add-on) | Rust/TypeScript Functions (Optional, Native) |
| Authentication | Netlify Identity (Add-on)      | Built-in Privacy-First Auth (Optional)       |
| Data / Storage | Add-ons (Forms, Large Media)   | Built-in Datastore & Storage (Optional)      |
| Core Benefit   | Convenience & speed            | Ownership, stability, independence           |

> **Important:** This comparison focuses on static hosting. Juno also offers integrated backend services, but you can adopt them only if/when needed.

## Cost Advantage: Predictable & Transparent Pricing

Netlify's free tier is generous — but as traffic and features scale, costs can rise quickly due to:

- Bandwidth overages
- Build minutes
- Paid add-ons (identity, serverless, large media)

Juno uses a simple usage-based model. You pay for compute and storage like a utility, without surprise bandwidth charges or per-feature pricing layers.

For long-running, growing projects, this creates financial predictability and independence.

---

## Simplicity First: Static Hosting Done Right

Both Netlify and Juno deliver a familiar, modern developer workflow:

- Git-based deployments
- Support for modern frameworks (Next.js static export, Astro, SvelteKit static, Vue, React, etc.)
- CLI-first developer experience

The difference is that **Juno gives you ownership from day one**, with the option to add backend capabilities as your app grows — without switching platforms.

Start static. Scale when you're ready.

## Performance Considerations

Netlify's edge network is highly optimized and may have the slight edge for globally-distributed, ultra-low-latency workloads.

Juno delivers competitive static performance with the benefit of independence and data sovereignty.

For most sites — documentation, marketing, dashboards, landing pages — Juno provides excellent real-world performance with long-term control.

---

## When Juno Makes the Most Sense

**Best fit for:**

- Static sites that may evolve into full apps later
- Projects where data independence and platform neutrality matter
- Teams planning long-term builds who want infrastructure control
- Builders who want the ease of Netlify with a clear path to autonomy

**Trade-offs to consider:**

- Smaller ecosystem vs Netlify's long-established plugins
- SSR not supported — Juno is optimized for static + client-side apps

If you're deploying a quick hobby site and don't have long-term infrastructure needs, Netlify remains a great choice.

If you want the same ease — with ownership, clarity, and room to scale — Juno is a powerful Netlify alternative.
