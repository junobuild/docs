# Internet Computer

Juno operates on the [Internet Computer] (ICP or IC), a blockchain unlike any other.

The IC is a set of protocols that allow for independent data centers around the world to join together and offer a decentralized alternative to the current centralized internet cloud providers, also known as Big Tech.

These independent parties run special "node machines" to produce the same number of blocks as other machines in their cohort, without deviation. Using a Proof-of-Useful-Work (PoUW) scheme. Their work involves replicating smart contract computations for optimal efficiency.

The innovative architecture, protocols, and cryptography make the [Internet Computer] the fastest blockchain, capable of serving web content directly from smart contracts.

This allows for 100% of online services to run on the blockchain, resulting in full decentralization and affordable costs.

It is estimated that storing 1 GB of data inside a smart contract should cost approximately $5 USD per year.
