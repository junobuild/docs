# FAQ

### Where do I find support?

For help and questions about best practices, join our [Discord](https://discord.gg/wHZ57Z2RAG) channel. You can report issue or bug on [GitHub](https://github.com/buildwithjuno/juno).

### How much does it cost?

Getting started is free. Developers are responsible for operating costs. Transaction costs may apply for some features. [Detailed information and estimations](./pricing.md) are available.

### What happens if Juno disappears?

In the unlikely event of Juno's disappearance, you, as the sole controller of your [mission control] and [satellites], would retain full control over your creations. They would continue to function independently without any reliance on Juno.

### Do you have a library for [some other language]?

We officially support [JavaScript](./add-juno-to-an-app/install-the-sdk-and-initialize-juno.md).

Community-supported libraries and contributions are warmly welcomed.

### How does Juno differ from Firebase?

Besides the fundamental differences between the Web2 and Web3 approaches, which empower developers using Juno with true control and future governance over their work, there are additional distinctions that apply regardless of the underlying philosophy.

#### Source

Firebase is a closed-source Backend as a Service that restricts access to the underlying details and limits the ability to make custom modifications.

In contrast, Juno is fully [open-source](https://github.com/buildwithjuno/), providing transparency and the flexibility to customize as needed.

#### Pricing

Firebase follows a usage-based pricing model, where costs are calculated based on factors like request volume and data storage. The absence of a cap-setting option is a cause for concern, as unexpected spikes in usage can result in substantial expenses.

In contrast, Juno takes a different approach. Developers pre-charge their smart contracts with [cycles](./terminology.md#cycles), which are then utilized to cover computation and memory usage of the [satellites] and [mission control]. This mechanism eliminates the risk of encountering unexpected financial burdens due to unforeseen usage surges.

### Where can I find resources about Juno?

The [documentation](./intro.md) is a great starting point to explore Juno.

Additionally, the [blog](https://juno.build/blog) provides insightful tutorials for various frameworks.

You can also check out the [repository](https://github.com/buildwithjuno/examples), which features multiple examples to help you get started.
