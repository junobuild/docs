## Upload file

When you upload a file, it becomes an **asset** stored in the Storage of your Satellite. Assets are accessible over the web and can be listed, deleted, or protected using tokens.

To upload a file, use the following code:

```typescript
import { uploadFile } from "@junobuild/core";

const result = await uploadFile({
  data,
  collection: "images"
});
```

#### Parameters

The `data` parameter is the file you want to upload. This is a `Blob`, typically selected using an HTML `<input type="file" />` element.

The `uploadFile` function provides various options, including:

- `filename`: By default, Juno uses the file's filename. You can overwrite this and provide a custom filename. Example: `myimage.jpg`.
- `fullPath`: The unique path where the asset will be stored and accessed. üëâ See [What is a `fullPath`?](#what-is-a-fullpath) for details and examples.
- `headers`: The headers can affect how the browser handles the asset. If no headers are provided Juno will infer the `Content-Type` from the file type.
- `encoding`: The type of encoding for the file. For example, `identity` (raw) or `gzip`.

:::note

- URL encoding is currently not supported on the Internet Computer. Therefore, it's important to keep in mind that your `filename` should not be encoded. That is why the library decodes the `filename` automatically.

:::

#### Returns

The function returns the uploaded asset key as an object with the following fields:

- `fullPath`: The unique path to the asset. Example: `/images/myimage.jpg`.
- `name`: The name of the asset (typically the filename). Example: `myimage.jpg`.
- `downloadUrl`: The URL to access the asset on the web or to download it. This URL can be used in a browser or embedded directly in HTML elements like `<img>` or `<a>`.

#### What is a `fullPath`?

The `fullPath` is the **unique path** of an asset within your Satellite's storage. It determines the asset‚Äôs public-facing URL and is used throughout the SDK to identify, retrieve, list, or delete the asset.

It always starts with a **slash**, and follows the structure:

```
/collection/filename
```

For example, uploading a file to the `"images"` collection with the filename `"logo.png"` results in:

```
/images/logo.png
```

#### Key points

- If the asset is **not part of the frontend**, the `fullPath` always includes the **collection** name.
- By default, the `fullPath` is automatically derived from the uploaded file's name (e.g. `/images/photo.jpg`).
- You can override the path using a custom filename. These are both valid:
- `/collection/hello.jpg`
- `/collection/my/sub/path/hello.jpg`
- The `fullPath` is effectively the **asset key** used in Juno Storage.
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Uploading a file to an existing `fullPath` will **overwrite** the existing file.

---

## Upload blob

The `uploadBlob` function works like [`uploadFile`](#upload-file) but does **not** infer the filename from the data.
You must explicitly provide the `filename`.

```typescript
import { uploadBlob } from "@junobuild/core";

const result = await uploadBlob({
  data: new Blob([myBuffer]),
  filename: "generated.jpg",
  collection: "images"
});
```

This is useful when uploading raw binary data that wasn't selected via a file input.

---

## Protected assets

While all assets can be found on the internet, it is possible to make their URL difficult to guess so that they remain undiscoverable (**as long as they are not shared**) and considered "private".

Juno achieves this by using an optional `token` query parameter.

```typescript
import { uploadFile } from "@junobuild/core";
import { nanoid } from "nanoid";

const result = await uploadFile({
  data,
  collection: "images",
  token: nanoid()
});
```

Imagine a file "mydata.jpg" uploaded with a token. Attempting to access it through the URL "https://yoursatellite/mydata.jpg" will not work. The asset can only be retrieved if a token is provided: "https://yoursatellite/mydata.jpg?token=a-super-long-secret-id".

---

## List assets

The `listAssets` function is used to retrieve assets from a specified collection.

```typescript
import { listAssets } from "@junobuild/core";

const myList = await listAssets({
  collection: "my_collection_key"
});
```

#### Parameters

The function requires a collection and accepts various optional parameters, including a matcher (a regex applied to the assets fullPaths and descriptions), pagination options, and sorting order.

:::note

`listAssets` uses the same interface as `listDocs`. That is why the parameter `matcher` expect a value `key` to filter the assets according their `fullPath`.

:::

1. **`collection`** (required)
   - **Description**: The key of the collection from which assets are to be listed.
   - **Type**: `string`

2. **`filter`** (optional)
   - **Description**: An optional object that can be used to provide various parameters to filter assets.

   a. **`matcher`** (optional)
   - **Description**: An object used to filter assets based on their keys (fullPaths) or descriptions using regular expressions.
   - **Type**: `ListMatcher`

     ```typescript
     interface ListMatcher {
       key?: string;
       description?: string;
       createdAt?: ListTimestampMatcher;
       updatedAt?: ListTimestampMatcher;
     }
     ```

     - **key**: A regex to match against asset keys.
     - **description**: A regex to match against asset descriptions.
     - **createdAt**: A `ListTimestampMatcher` to filter assets based on their creation timestamp.
     - **updatedAt**: A `ListTimestampMatcher` to filter assets based on their last update timestamp.

   - **Type**: `ListTimestampMatcher` can be used to specify criteria for timestamp matching.

     ```typescript
     type ListTimestampMatcher =
       | {
           matcher: "equal";
           timestamp: bigint;
         }
       | {
           matcher: "greaterThan";
           timestamp: bigint;
         }
       | {
           matcher: "lessThan";
           timestamp: bigint;
         }
       | {
           matcher: "between";
           timestamps: {
             start: bigint;
             end: bigint;
           };
         };
     ```

     - **matcher**: Specifies the type of timestamp comparison. Can be one of the following:
       - **equal**: Matches assets where the timestamp is exactly equal to the specified value.
       - **greaterThan**: Matches assets where the timestamp is greater than the specified value.
       - **lessThan**: Matches assets where the timestamp is less than the specified value.
       - **between**: Matches assets where the timestamp falls within a specified range.

     - **timestamp**: Used with `equal`, `greaterThan`, and `lessThan` matchers to specify the exact timestamp for comparison.
     - **timestamps**: Used with the `between` matcher to specify a range of timestamps. The range is inclusive of both the start and end values.

   b. **`paginate`** (optional)
   - **Description**: An object to control pagination of the results
   - **Type**: `ListPaginate`

     ```typescript
     interface ListPaginate {
       startAfter?: string;
       limit?: number;
     }
     ```

     - **startAfter**: A string key to start listing assets after this key.
     - **limit**: The maximum number of assets to return.

   c. **`order`** (optional)
   - **Description**: Control the sorting order of the results.
   - **Type**: `ListOrder`

     ```typescript
     interface ListOrder {
       desc: boolean;
       field: ListOrderField;
     }

     type ListOrderField = "keys" | "updated_at" | "created_at";
     ```

   d. **`owner`** (optional)
   - **Description**: The owner of the assets.
   - **Type**: `ListOwner`

     ```typescript
     type ListOwner = string | Principal;
     ```

:::note[Example]
Usage of the parameters:

```typescript
import { listDocs } from "@junobuild/core";

const myList = await listDocs({
  collection: "my_collection_key",
  filter: {
    matcher: {
      key: ".*.png$", // match assets with .png extension
      description: "holiday", // match description containing 'holiday'
      createdAt: {
        matcher: "greaterThan",
        timestamp: 1627776000n
      },
      updatedAt: {
        matcher: "between",
        timestamps: {
          start: 1627770000n,
          end: 1627900000n
        }
      }
    },
    paginate: {
      startAfter: "doc_10",
      limit: 5
    },
    order: {
      desc: true,
      field: "updated_at"
    },
    owner: "some_owner_id_or_principal"
  }
});
```

:::

The function returns the assets and various information, in the form of an object whose interface is given below.

```typescript
{
  items: []; // The data - array of assets without their content
  items_length: bigint; // The number of assets - basically items.length
  items_page?: bigint; // If the query is paginated, at what page (starting from 0) do the items find the place
  matches_length: bigint; // The total number of matching results
  matches_pages?: bigint; // If the query is paginated, the total number (starting from 0) of pages
}
```

## Download URL

The `downloadUrl` function is used to generate a public URL for accessing a specific asset stored on a Satellite.

:::note

You get similar information directly from the result of an upload.
This function can be used to generate the URL on the fly.

:::

This URL can be used to:

- Open the file directly in a browser
- Embed the asset in HTML elements such as `<img src="...">` or `<a href="...">`
- Trigger a download when used in an `<a href="..." download>` link

```typescript
import { downloadUrl } from "@junobuild/core";

const url = downloadUrl({
  assetKey: {
    fullPath: "/images/logo.png",
    token: "a-secret-token" // optional
  }
});

// Example usage
<img src={url} alt="Logo" />
```

#### Parameters

- **`assetKey`** (required)
- **`fullPath`**: The full path to the asset (e.g., `/images/file.jpg`).
- **`token`** (optional): A secret token used to access protected assets.

- **`satellite`** (optional)
  Required only in Node.js environments to specify which Satellite to use.

#### Returns

- A `string` representing the full URL to access the asset.

:::note

If a `token` is provided when uploading the asset, it must also be included in the URL to access it. This makes the asset effectively private until shared with the token.

:::

## Count assets

The `countAssets` function is used to count the number of assets in a specified collection without retrieving the actual assets.

```typescript
import { countAssets } from "@junobuild/core";

const assetCount = await countAssets({
  collection: "my_collection_key"
});
```

#### Usage

This function accepts similar parameters as the `listAssets` function, including `collection`, `matcher`, and `owner`, and returns the count of matching documents.

For detailed information on how to use these parameters, refer to the [List assets](#list-assets) section.

The return value is the same as the `items_length` property from the `listAssets` function, providing the count of assets that match the criteria.

---

## Delete

There are multiple ways to delete assets from your Storage.

### Delete asset

To delete an asset, you only need to provide its `fullPath`. Unlike the [datastore](../datastore/index.mdx), there is no timestamp validation performed when deleting an asset.

```typescript
import { deleteAsset } from "@junobuild/core";

await deleteAsset({
  collection: "images",
  storageFile: myAsset
});
```

### Delete multiple assets

To delete multiple assets in an atomic manner, you can use the function `deleteManyAssets`:

```typescript
import { deleteManyAssets } from "@junobuild/core";

const myAsset1 = {
  collection: "hello",
  fullPath: "/hello/world.jpg"
};

const myAsset2 = {
  collection: "data",
  fullPath: "/data/something.json"
};

await deleteManyAssets({ assets: [myAsset1, myAsset2] });
```

### Delete filtered assets

The `deleteFilteredAssets` function allows you to delete multiple assets from a collection based on specific filter criteria. This function simplifies bulk deletions by leveraging the same parameters as the [listAssets](#list-assets) function for filtering.

```typescript
import { deleteFilteredAssets } from "@junobuild/core";

await deleteFilteredAssets({
  collection: "my_collection_key",
  filter: {
    // Uses the same filter options as listAssets
  }
});
```
