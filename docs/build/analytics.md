# Analytics

Juno Analytics, a simple, lightweight, and open-source web3 analytics solution that respects your users' privacy. Unlike traditional analytics tools, Juno Analytics doesn't use cookies, ensuring anonymity while providing valuable user insights.

## Features

Juno Analytics offers several advantages for developers:

### No Cookie Banners Required

Just like all of Juno's features, Analytics prioritizes privacy. It conducts dapp and site measurements entirely anonymously, without using cookies or collecting personal data. There are no persistent identifiers, cross-site tracking, or cross-device tracking. Your analytics data is not used for any other purposes.

### Lightweight Script

Juno's JavaScript library for statistics is optimized for performance. It consists of a minimal main script that seamlessly integrates with your application's UI and a dedicated worker responsible for handling logic and cryptography. This design ensures that adding analytics won't impact your application's performance, including its boot time, and per extension preserving your customer acquisition rate.

### Track Goal Conversions and Campaigns

Beyond standard page views, you can gain valuable insights into your visitors by creating custom events to track conversions and attribution.

### Transparent and Fully Open Source

Juno is fully open source, including all its Analytics features, setting it apart from proprietary tools like Google Analytics.

Furthermore, unlike any other analytics alternative or solution, Juno's long-term vision is to evolve into a decentralized organization (DAO), embracing a new paradigm in the analytics industry.
