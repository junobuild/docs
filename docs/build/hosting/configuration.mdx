- Customize `assertions` to modify the default verification behavior of the CLI. [Learn how.](#assertions)

#### Where do you define your Hosting configuration?

You define your Hosting configuration in your Juno configuration file. The CLI automatically creates the file at the root of your project directory when you run the [juno init](../../miscellaneous/cli#init) or [juno deploy](../../miscellaneous/cli#deploy) command for the first time.

#### How do you apply your changes?

To apply any changes you make in your configuration to your satellite, execute the [juno config](../../miscellaneous/cli#config) command with the CLI.

### Source

import Source from "../components/source.mdx";

<Source />

### Ignore files

import IgnoreFiles from "../components/ignore-files.mdx";

<IgnoreFiles />

### HTTP Headers

import HttpHeaders from "../components/http-headers.mdx";

<HttpHeaders />

### Customize a 404/Not Found page

By default, all unknown paths are automatically rewritten to `/index.html`. However, if you wish to serve a custom `404 Not Found` error when a user attempts to access a non-existent page, you can do so without requiring additional configuration.

Simply upload a custom `404.html` file to your satellite that should be served from the root path of your site.
