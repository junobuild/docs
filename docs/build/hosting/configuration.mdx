## Where do you define your Hosting configuration?

Your hosting configuration is defined in the Juno [configuration](../../reference/configuration.mdx) file, which is automatically created when you run [juno config init](../../reference/cli#init) or [juno hosting deploy](../../reference/cli#deploy) for the first time.

---

## How do you apply your changes?

To apply any changes, execute the [juno config apply](../../reference/cli#apply) command with the CLI.

## Options

The list below outlines the available hosting options you can configure to tailor your hosting.

### Source

import Source from "../components/source.mdx";

<Source />

### Ignore files

<IgnoreFiles />

### HTTP Headers

import HttpHeaders from "../components/http-headers.mdx";

### Customize a 404/Not Found page

By default, all unknown paths are automatically rewritten to `/index.html`. However, if you wish to serve a custom `404 Not Found` error when a user attempts to access a non-existent page, you can do so without requiring additional configuration.

Simply upload a custom `404.html` file to your satellite that should be served from the root path of your site.
