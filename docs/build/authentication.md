# Authentication

Juno allows you to securely identify users **anonymously** and save their data on the blockchain.

Our easy-to-use SDKs support authentication through [Internet Identity] and [NFID].

Juno Authentication integrates tightly with other Juno services like [datastore](datastore.md) and [storage](storage.md).

You can manage your users in the [authentication](https://console.juno.build/auhtentication) view in Juno's console. A new entry is created when a user successfully signs in (see below).

:::note

The Juno SDK must be [installed](../add-juno-to-an-app/install-the-sdk-and-initialize-juno.md) and initialized in your app to use the authentication features.

:::

## Sign-in

You can authorize an existing or new user with the identity provider using `signIn`.

```typescript
import { signIn } from "@junobuild/core";

await signIn();
```

The sign-in feature has options to customize the authentication:

- `maxTimeToLive`: a maximum time to live (**4 hours** per default, `BigInt(4 * 60 * 60 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000)`)

:::note

The duration is given. It remains unchanged, regardless of whether the users are active or inactive.

:::

- `derivationOrigin`: a specific parameter of [Internet Identity](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ii-spec#alternative-frontend-origins)
- `windowed`: by default, the authentication flow is presented to the user in a popup that is automatically centered on desktop. This behavior can be disabled by setting the option to `false`. In that case, the authentication flow will occur in a separate tab.

You can configure the default sign-in flow that uses Internet Identity. You can also set NFID as a provider. Check out the [advanced Sign-in guidelines](#sign-in-providers) for more details.

## Sign-out

You can end a user's session by logging them out.

```typescript
import { signOut } from "@junobuild/core";

await signOut();
```

:::note

This will clear the sign-in information stored in IndexedDB.

:::

## Subscription

You can subscribe to the user state (signed-in or out) by using the subscriber function. This function provides a technical user and will trigger whenever the user's state changes.

```typescript
import { authSubscribe } from "@junobuild/core";

authSubscribe((user: User | null) => {
  console.log("User:", user);
});
```

If you register the subscriber at the top of your application, it will propagate the user's state accordingly (e.g. `null` when a new user opens the app, the new user's entry when they sign in, the existing user when they refresh the browser within the valid duration, and `null` again when they sign out).

Subscribing returns a callback that can be executed to unsubscribe:

```typescript
import { authSubscribe } from "@junobuild/core";

const unsubscribe = authSubscribe((user: User | null) => {
  console.log("User:", user);
});

// Above subscriber ends now
unsubscribe();
```

## Advanced

Here are a few advanced recipes to customize your sign-in flow and detect session expiration.

### Sign-In Providers

Juno currently supports Internet Identity and NFID, with NFID offering additional authentication methods such as Google, Metamask, and WalletConnect.

#### Internet Identity

Internet Identity offers two available domains: `internetcomputer.org` and `ic0.app`.

By default, the SDK uses `internetcomputer.org` because we anticipate it will become the main domain in the future.

```typescript
import { signIn, InternetIdentityProvider } from "@junobuild/core";

// Default domain is 'internetcomputer.org'
await signIn({
  provider: new InternetIdentityProvider({}),
});
```

To switch to the `ic0.app`, set the domain as follows.

```typescript
import { signIn, InternetIdentityProvider } from "@junobuild/core";

await signIn({
  provider: new InternetIdentityProvider({
    domain: "ic0.app",
  }),
});
```

#### NFID

To set up NFID, you need to configure the corresponding provider and provide your application name and a link to your logo.

```typescript
import { signIn, NFIDProvider } from "@junobuild/core";

await signIn({
  provider: new NFIDProvider({
    appName: "Your app name",
    logoUrl: "https://somewhere.com/your_logo.png",
  }),
});
```

:::note

You can implement the `signIn` function in your application as many times as you wish, with various configurations. It is perfectly acceptable to use both Internet Identity and NFID within the same project.

:::

### Session Expiration

To proactively detect when a session duration expires, you can use the pre-bundled Web Worker provided by Juno's SDK.

To do so, you can follow these steps:

1. Copy the worker file provided by Juno's SDK to your app's static folder. For example, to your `public` folder with a NPM `postinstall` script:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "node -e \"require('fs').cpSync('node_modules/@junobuild/core/dist/workers/', './static/workers', {recursive: true});\""
  }
}
```

Once configured, run `npm run postinstall` manually to trigger the initial copy. Every time you run `npm ci`, the post-install target will execute, ensuring the worker is copied.

2. Enable the option when you initialize Juno:

```javascript
import { initJuno } from "@junobuild/core";

await initJuno({
  satelliteId: "aaaaa-bbbbb-ccccc-ddddd-cai",
  workers: {
    auth: true,
  },
});
```

The `auth` option can accept either `true`, which will default to using a worker located at https://yourapp/workers/auth.worker.js, or a custom `string` to provide your own URL.

When the session expires, it will automatically be terminated with a standard [sign-out](#sign-out). Additionally, an event called `junoSignOutAuthTimer` will be thrown at the `document` level. This event can be used, for example, to display a warning to your users or if you wish to reload the window.

```javascript
document.addEventListener("junoSignOutAuthTimer", () => {
    // Display an information to your users
}), {passive: true});
```

The worker also emits an event named `junoDelegationRemainingTime`, which provides the remaining duration in milliseconds of the authentication delegation. This can be useful if you want to display to your users how much time remains in their active session.

```javascript
document.addEventListener("junoDelegationRemainingTime", ({detail: remainingTime}) => {
    // Display the remaining session duration to your users
}), {passive: true});
```
