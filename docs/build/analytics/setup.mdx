# Setup

This section covers how to integrate and configure Juno Analytics in your app or website.

---

## Getting Started

Before integrating Juno Analytics into your app or website, you need to create an Orbiter - the smart contract that implements analytics features and gathers data. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:

1. Sign in to the Juno [Console](https://console.juno.build)
2. Navigate to [Analytics](https://console.juno.build/analytics/)
3. Click on **Get started**
4. Confirm by selecting **Create analytics**
5. (Optional) In **Advanced Options**, choose a European subnet if you want your data stored in Europe
6. Once the setup completes, click **Close** to exit the wizard

ðŸŽ‰ Youâ€™ve now created your Analytics Orbiter!

But you're not done yet â€” you still need to tell it which Satellites (apps) can send data.

ðŸ›  **Final Step: Setup Tracking**

Go to the [Setup](https://console.juno.build/analytics/?tab=setup) tab in the Analytics page and select which Satellites should be allowed to track page views and events.

## Setup

Everything you need to get Juno Analytics up and running in your app.

---

### Install the Library

To install the analytics library, run the following command:

import Analytics from "../components/analytics.mdx";

<Analytics />

---

### Configure

If you're using the [Next.js](../../reference/plugins.md#nextjs-plugin) or [Vite](../../reference/plugins.md#vite-plugin), add your configuration in `juno.config`.

```javascript title="juno.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    id: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai",
    source: "dist"
  },
  orbiter: {
    id: "aaaa-bbbbb-ccccc-ddddd-cai" // <-- Replace with your ID
  }
});
```

If you're not using a plugin, you can skip this step and instead provide the IDs manually when initializing the Orbiter (see next section).

---

### Initialize

âœ… Using plugins and config

Just call `initOrbiter()` as early as possible in your app startup:

```typescript
import { initOrbiter } from "@junobuild/analytics";

initOrbiter();
```

ðŸ›  Without plugins

Pass your Satellite and Orbiter IDs manually:

```typescript
import { initOrbiter } from "@junobuild/analytics";

// TODO: Replace the following satelliteId and orbiterId with the effective ID.
initOrbiter({
  satelliteId: "aaaaa-bbbbb-ccccc-ddddd-cai",
  orbiterId: "eeeee-fffff-ddddd-11111-cai"
});
```

## Best Practices

Here are some useful tips for working with the analytics.

### Production vs Development

While the example above shows analytics being initialized in all cases, itâ€™s recommended to **disable analytics during local development**. This prevents test data from polluting your metrics if your local environment is connected to production, and avoids errors when analytics aren't set up locally which is often the case during development.

```javascript
if (DEV) {
  return;
}

initOrbiter();
```

### Use Environment-Specific IDs

You can also configure different IDs for different environments (e.g., development and production):

```javascript title="juno.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    id: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai",
    source: "dist"
  },
  orbiter: {
    ids: {
      production: "aaaa-bbbbb-ccccc-ddddd-cai",
      development: "ffff-eeee-ddddd-ccccc-cai"
    }
  }
});
```
