# Development

When you're ready to implement Functions within your Juno Satellite, you'll have a variety of event-driven macros at your disposal, enabling custom logic execution in response to specific actions. Here's how to implement each available Function:

---

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to define event-driven logic that responds to specific actions within your Satellite. The following is a list of available hooks and their respective use cases.

### on_set_doc

import OnSetDoc from "./components/on-set-doc.mdx";

<OnSetDoc />

### on_set_many_docs

import OnSetManyDocs from "./components/on-set-many-docs.mdx";

<OnSetManyDocs />

### on_delete_doc

import OnDeleteDoc from "./components/on-delete-doc.mdx";

<OnDeleteDoc />

### on_delete_many_docs

import OnDeleteManyDocs from "./components/on-delete-many-docs.mdx";

<OnDeleteManyDocs />

### on_delete_filtered_docs

import OnDeleteFilteredDocs from "./components/on-delete-filtered-docs.mdx";

<OnDeleteFilteredDocs />

### on_upload_asset

import OnUploadAsset from "./components/on-upload-asset.mdx";

<OnUploadAsset />

### on_delete_asset

import OnDeleteAsset from "./components/on-delete-asset.mdx";

<OnDeleteAsset />

### on_delete_many_assets

import OnDeleteManyAssets from "./components/on-delete-many-assets.mdx";

<OnDeleteManyAssets />

### on_delete_filtered_assets

import OnDeleteFilteredAssets from "./components/on-delete-filtered-assets.mdx";

<OnDeleteFilteredAssets />

### on_init

import OnInit from "./components/on-init.mdx";

<OnInit />

### on_post_upgrade

import OnPostUpgrade from "./components/on-post-upgrade.mdx";

<OnPostUpgrade />

---

## Assertions

Assertions enable validation checks before specific actions are executed within your Satellite. The following is a list of available assertions and their functionalities.

### assert_set_doc

import AssertSetDoc from "./components/assert-set-doc.mdx";

<AssertSetDoc />

### assert_delete_doc

import AssertDeleteDoc from "./components/assert-delete-doc.mdx";

<AssertDeleteDoc />

### assert_upload_asset

import AssertUploadAsset from "./components/assert-upload-asset.mdx";

<AssertUploadAsset />

### assert_delete_asset

import AssertDeleteAsset from "./components/assert-delete-asset.mdx";

<AssertDeleteAsset />

---

## When the Functions Run

import Collections from "./components/collections.mdx";

<Collections />
