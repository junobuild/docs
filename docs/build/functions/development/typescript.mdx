## Maintenance

Since your project includes all Satellite features, it's essential to stay in sync with Junoâ€™s updates to maintain compatibility.

Always check the [releases](https://github.com/junobuild/juno/releases) page for the latest changes, and update your local Docker image (source [repo](https://github.com/junobuild/juno-docker)) accordingly to ensure you're running the latest runtime and features.
