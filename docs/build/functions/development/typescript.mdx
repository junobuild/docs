This page covers advanced options for writing serverless functions in TypeScript.

## Maintenance

Since your project includes all Satellite features, it's essential to stay in sync with Juno’s updates to maintain compatibility.

Always check the [releases](https://github.com/junobuild/juno/releases) page for the latest changes, and update your local container image (source [repo](https://github.com/junobuild/juno-docker)) accordingly to ensure you're running the latest runtime and features.

## Versioning

When writing serverless functions in TypeScript, Juno uses the version defined in your project’s `package.json`. This version is embedded into the compiled Wasm module and shown in the Juno Console, making it easier to keep track of deployments.

By default, the version is inherited from the root-level `version` field:

```json
{
  "name": "demo",
  "version": "0.0.10"
}
```

However, if you want to version your functions independently from your app or workspace, you can define a custom version field specifically for Juno Functions:

```json
{
  "name": "demo",
  "version": "0.0.10",
  "juno": {
    "functions": {
      "version": "0.0.4"
    }
  }
}
```

<Versioning />
