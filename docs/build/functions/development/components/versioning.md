This version is embedded into the compiled Wasm binary and displayed in the Juno Console. It helps you:

- Track which version of your serverless logic is currently deployed.
- Debug more effectively by matching behavior in the Console with specific code versions.
- Move independently of Juno updates â€” you're in full control of your own function versioning.

You can use any versioning scheme that suits your development workflow (e.g. `0.1.0`, `1.0.0-beta`, `2025.04.18`...).
