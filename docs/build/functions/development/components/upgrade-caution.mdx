Always upgrade iteratively and avoid skipping version numbers. While we strive to minimize breaking changes, it's crucial to upgrade through each released version sequentially.

For example, if you're on **v0.0.23** and the latest release is **v0.0.26**, first upgrade to **v0.0.24**, then **v0.0.25**, and finally **v0.0.26**. Skipping versions could lead to unexpected issues.
