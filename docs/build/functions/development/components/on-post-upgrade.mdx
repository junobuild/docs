  Invoked after the Satellite has been upgraded to a new version. This hook is
  typically used to manage migration tasks, or starting custom processes like
  timers.
</p>

```rust
#[on_post_upgrade]
fn on_post_upgrade() -> Result<(), String> {
    // Custom logic for post-upgrade tasks
    Ok(())
}
```

Similar to `on_init`, the `on_post_upgrade` hook cannot be scoped to collections or assets. It operates globally to handle upgrade-related operations.

This feature is not enabled by default. To use it, you’ll need to opt in by updating your `Cargo.toml` file.

```toml
[dependencies]
junobuild-satellite = { version = "*", features = ["default", "on_post_upgrade"] }
```

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript" attributes={{className: styles.hidden}}>
```

<p className={`${styles.revertMarginTop} ${styles.italic}`}>
  This hook is not available when writing functions in TypeScript.
</p>

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
</Tabs>
```
