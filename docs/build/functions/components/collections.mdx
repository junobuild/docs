When no attributes are provided, the hook is triggered for any document set in any collection. For better control and performance, it’s recommended to scope the hook to a specific list of `collections`.

This behavior applies to **all hooks and assertions**, except for the lifecycle hooks such as `on_init` or `on_post_upgrade`, which operate globally.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript" attributes={{className: styles.hidden}}>
```

A hook is only executed if the function is declared and exported. Additionally, the `collections` field must be defined. If it's empty, the hook will not run.

This behavior applies to **all hooks and assertions**, except for the lifecycle hooks such as `on_init` or `on_post_upgrade`, which operate globally.

<TabItem value="Rust">
```

```rust
#[on_set_doc(collections = ["demo"])]
async fn on_set_doc(context: OnSetDocContext) -> Result<(), String> {
    // Custom logic for handling document creation or updates
    Ok(())
}
```

The attributes accept a list of comma-separated collections. If the attribute array is left empty, the hook will never be called.

```mdx-code-block
</TabItem>
<TabItem value="TypeScript">
```

```typescript
export const onSetDoc = defineHook<OnSetDoc>({
  collections: ["demo"],
  run: async (context) => {
    // Custom logic for handling document creation or updates
  }
});
```

The `collections` attribute accepts a list of comma-separated collection names.
