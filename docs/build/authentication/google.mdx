# Google

Google Sign-In lets users authenticate with their existing Google account using OpenID Connect (OIDC) - a modern, secure identity standard built on top of OAuth 2.0.

This provides a fast and familiar experience for users, without you having to manage passwords or credentials directly.

It's the easiest way to onboard users who expect a simple, frictionless login flow that works across devices and browsers.

---

## How It Works

1. The user signs in with Google.
2. Google verifies their credentials and issues a signed OpenID Connect token.
3. Your Satellite verifies the token and its signature, and extracts the user's information (such as email or profile).
4. It then establishes a session for the user.

:::note

Google authentication is not domain-scoped. A user signing in with the same Google account will have the same identity across all domains pointing to the same Satellite.

## Configuration

To enable Google authentication for your project:

### 1. Get your Google credentials

Start by creating your Google credentials.

It's best to use a separate Google Cloud project for each environment (development, staging, production) so you can keep configurations clean and secure.

1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/dashboard).
2. Create a new project (or select one for your current environment). You might need to switch to your newly created project after creating it.
3. If you created a new project, configure the OAuth consent screen with information about your app. Click Configure consent screen when prompted.
4. Open **APIs & Services → Credentials**.
5. Click **Create Credentials → OAuth Client ID**.
6. Select **Web application** as the application type.

Then, configure your redirect URIs.

For local development, you can use something like `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback/google`. In production, use the URL that matches your deployed app, for example `https://example.com/auth/callback/google`.

The exact redirect path depends on how your app handles authentication, but make sure you always set at least one redirect URI in your Google Console.

:::caution

Creating a separate OAuth 2.0 Client ID for each environment and always configuring **Authorized redirect URIs** is a must.

Since the Client ID is public, leaving redirect URIs open could let attackers interfere with your authentication flow. Likewise, keeping a localhost URL alongside your production redirect is also a security risk.

It's also recommended to set Authorized JavaScript origins, which will be used once FedCM (Federated Credential Management) support is added.

### 2. Configure the provider

Once your credentials are ready, you need to add your Google Client ID to your project configuration.

In your `juno.config` file:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    ids: {
      development: "<DEV_SATELLITE_ID>",
      production: "<PROD_SATELLITE_ID>"
    },
    source: "dist",
    authentication: {
      google: {
        clientId: "1234567890-abcde12345fghijklmno.apps.googleusercontent.com"
      }
    }
  }
});
```

If you use different Client IDs for each environment (as recommended), you can leverage the build mode to load configuration conditionally.

For example, to enable Google Sign-In only in production:

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig(({ mode }) => ({
  satellite: {
    ids: {
      development: "<DEV_SATELLITE_ID>",
      production: "<PROD_SATELLITE_ID>"
    },
    source: "dist",
    ...(mode === "production" && {
      authentication: {
        google: {
          clientId: "1234567890-abcde12345fghijklmno.apps.googleusercontent.com"
        }
      }
    })
  }
}));
```

### 3. Apply the configuration

Once your credentials are set in `juno.config`, you need to make sure both your frontend and your Satellite are using the correct and same Google Client ID.

import ApplyConfiguration from "../components/apply_configuration.mdx";

<ApplyConfiguration provider="Google" />

---

## Sign-In

Once your configuration is ready, you can let users sign in with their Google account.

```typescript
import { signIn } from "@junobuild/core";

await signIn({
  google: {}
});
```

This starts the standard Google redirect flow.

After the user authenticates, they should be redirected to the URL you configured as an Authorized redirect URI in the Google Cloud Console.

You can pass this URL through the `redirectUrl` option. If you omit it, the current origin (`window.location.origin`) is used.

### Options

Google sign-in supports a few options that let you control scopes, redirect URLs, and the overall sign-in experience.

| Option        | Type               | Default                          | Description                                                                                                                              |
| ------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `clientId`    | `string`           | from `juno.config`               | Your Google OAuth Client ID. If not provided, it is automatically read from your project configuration using the plugins.                |
| `redirectUrl` | `string`           | `window.location.origin`         | The URL where the user is redirected after sign-in. It must match one of your authorized redirect URIs in the Google Cloud Console.      |
| `authScopes`  | `GoogleAuthScopes` | `['openid', 'profile', 'email']` | OAuth scopes to request. Must include `openid` and at least one of `profile` or `email`.                                                 |
| `loginHint`   | `string`           |                                  | Optional hint such as an email address that tells Google which user is likely signing in. Helps skip the account picker for known users. |

Example:

```typescript
import { signIn } from "@junobuild/core";

await signIn({
  google: {
    redirect: {
      clientId: "1234567890-abcde12345fghijklmno.apps.googleusercontent.com",
      authScopes: ["openid", "email"],
      redirectUrl: "https://example.com/auth/callback/google",
      loginHint: "user@example.com"
    }
  }
});
```

---

## Handling the Redirect

After authentication, Google redirects the user back to your app with a signed token. You must handle that redirect on the route that matches your configured `redirectUrl`. For example, `/auth/callback/google`.

```typescript
import { handleRedirectCallback } from "@junobuild/core";

await handleRedirectCallback({ google: null });
```

If the callback is successful, the user is signed in and a session is created.

:::tip

After handling the redirect, it's best to navigate elsewhere in your app without keeping browser history. This prevents the user from re-triggering authentication when pressing the back button.

:::

---

import AdvancedConfiguration from "../components/advanced_configuration.md";

<AdvancedConfiguration />

Example configuration:

```typescript
authentication: {
  google: {
    clientId: "1234567890-abcde12345fghijklmno.apps.googleusercontent.com"
  },
  delegation: {
    allowedTargets: ["<YOUR_SATELLITE_ID>", "<LEDGER_CANISTER_ID>"],
    sessionDuration: BigInt(7 * 24 * 60 * 60 * 1_000_000_000) // 7 days
  }
}
```

## Recommendations

- ⚠️ Always configure **Authorized redirect URIs** in the Google Cloud Console.
- Use a separate **OAuth Client ID** for each environment (development, staging, production).
- Keep your frontend and Satellite **Client IDs** in sync.
- Do not leave a **localhost URI** next to production URIs in the same Client ID.
- In the future, Juno will support **FedCM (Federated Credential Management)** for Google Sign-In without redirects.

---

## Infrastructure Overview

When you enable Google Sign-In, authentication involves two systems: Google and your Satellite.

Google handles the user-facing part — displaying the sign-in screen and issuing a signed OpenID Connect (OIDC) token once the user authenticates.

From there, everything else runs within your Satellite container:

- The Satellite verifies the token's signature.
- It prepares and signs a delegation identity that represents the authenticated user session.
- It creates (or retrieves) the user entry that your app can then use with Juno services such as [Datastore](../datastore/index.mdx) and [Storage](../storage/index.mdx).

### Token Verification

OIDC tokens are signed by Google using rotating public keys (JWKS). Therefore, to verify these signatures, Satellites need access to those keys.

Instead of having each Satellite perform HTTPS outcalls to Google — which would add cost and subnet load — Juno provides these keys through a shared infrastructure module called [Observatory](../../miscellaneous/architecture.md#observatory).

Observatory regularly fetches and caches Google's public keys, ensuring that verification inside your Satellite remains fast and reliable without introducing additional overhead.

This setup means your Satellite **trusts Juno** to deliver the correct, untempered, up-to-date keys.

If you prefer to control this part as well, or if you want to improve redundancy in your setup while taking care of the related cost, you can spin your own Observatory instance. Reach out if you're interested in setting that up.
