# Development

This page provides an overview of how to integrate authentication features with the Juno SDK, including sign-in, sign-out, and user session subscription within your app.

:::note

The Juno SDK must be [installed](../../setup-the-sdk.mdx) and initialized in your app to use the authentication features.

## Sign-in

You can authorize an existing or new user with the identity provider using `signIn`.

```typescript
import { signIn } from "@junobuild/core";

await signIn();
```

The sign-in feature offers customization options for authentication:

- `maxTimeToLive`: Specifies the duration for the session (defaults to **4 hours**, represented as `BigInt(4 * 60 * 60 * 1000 * 1000 * 1000)`). It's **important** to note that this duration remains constant, whether the users are active or inactive.
- `windowed`: By default, the authentication flow is presented in a popup window on desktop that is automatically centered on the browser. This behavior can be turned off by setting the option to `false`, causing the authentication flow to happen in a separate tab instead.
- `derivationOrigin`: The main domain to be used to ensure your users are identified with the same public ID, regardless of which of your satelliteâ€™s URLs they use to access your application.
- `allowPin`: We consider the specific PIN authentication method of [Internet Identity](https://internetcomputer.org/docs/current/references/ii-spec#client-authentication-protocol) as "insecure" because users can easily lose their login information if they do not register a passphrase, particularly as Safari clears the browser cache every two weeks in cases of inactivity. This is why we **disable** it by default.

You can configure the default sign-in flow that uses Internet Identity. You can also set NFID as a provider. Check out the [advanced Sign-in guidelines](#sign-in-providers) for more details.

## Sign-out

You can end a user's session by logging them out.

```typescript
import { signOut } from "@junobuild/core";

await signOut();
```

:::note

This will clear the sign-in information stored in IndexedDB.

## Subscription

You can subscribe to the user state (signed-in or out) by using the subscriber function. This function provides a technical user and will trigger whenever the user's state changes.

```typescript
import { authSubscribe } from "@junobuild/core";

authSubscribe((user: User | null) => {
  console.log("User:", user);
});
```

If you register the subscriber at the top of your application, it will propagate the user's state accordingly (e.g. `null` when a new user opens the app, the new user's entry when they sign in, the existing user when they refresh the browser within the valid duration, and `null` again when they sign out).

Subscribing returns a callback that can be executed to unsubscribe:

```typescript
import { authSubscribe } from "@junobuild/core";

const unsubscribe = authSubscribe((user: User | null) => {
  console.log("User:", user);
});

// Above subscriber ends now
unsubscribe();
```
