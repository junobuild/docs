When deploying your application, the CLI automatically searches for JavaScript (js), ES Module (mjs), CSS (css) and HTML (html) files in the `source` folder to optimize them using Gzip compression. This improves the performance of your app when it is served on the web.

By default, precompression stores **both** the original and compressed versions in Storage.

You can disable it entirely or customize which files are precompressed, whether to keep originals, and which compression algorithm to use.

## Disable precompression

Set the `precompress` option to `false` in your configuration:

```javascript title="juno.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    ids: {
      production: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai"
    },
    source: "dist",
    precompress: false
  }
});
```

## Customize the file matching pattern

If you want to customize the default pattern `**/*.+(css|js|mjs|html)` to better suit your needs, you can specify your own pattern. For example:

```javascript title="juno.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    ids: {
      production: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai"
    },
    source: "dist",
    precompress: {
      pattern: "**/*.jpg" // precompress JPEG files only
    }
  }
});
```

## Decide what happens to original files

The `mode` option controls what happens to the original files after compression:

- `"both"` — upload both the original and the compressed version. _(default)_
- `"replace"` — upload only the compressed version and serve it with the appropriate `Content-Encoding` header.

```javascript title="juno.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    ids: {
      production: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai"
    },
    source: "dist",
    precompress: {
      mode: "replace"
    }
  }
});
```
