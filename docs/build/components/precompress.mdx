When deploying your application, the CLI automatically searches for files matching the pattern `**/*.+(css|js|mjs|html)` in the `source` folder to optimize them using Gzip compression. This improves the performance of your app when it is served on the web.

By default, precompression stores **both** the original and compressed versions in Storage.

You can disable it entirely or customize which files are precompressed, whether to keep originals, and which compression algorithm to use.

:::note

If you change the precompress configuration and your project has already been deployed, run `juno hosting clear` before redeploying to ensure you change is applied.

:::

#### Disable precompression

Set the `precompress` option to `false` in your configuration:

```javascript title="juno.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    ids: {
      production: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai"
    },
    source: "dist",
    precompress: false
  }
});
```

#### Customize the file matching pattern

If you want to customize the default pattern `**/*.+(css|js|mjs|html)` to better suit your needs, you can specify your own pattern. For example:

```javascript title="juno.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    ids: {
      production: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai"
    },
    source: "dist",
    precompress: {
      pattern: "**/*.jpg" // precompress JPEG files only
    }
  }
});
```

#### Decide what happens to original files

The `mode` option controls what happens to the original files after compression:

- `"both"` — upload both the original and the compressed version. _(default)_
- `"replace"` — upload only the compressed version and serve it with the appropriate `Content-Encoding` header.

:::warning

If you use `replace` for HTML, some social media crawlers (e.g. Twitter, LinkedIn) may not be able to fetch your pages correctly, resulting in missing or broken social previews.

To avoid this, instead of providing a single precompression rule, it's recommended to fine-tune the behavior using an **array of rules** ([see below](#use-multiple-rules)).

:::

```javascript title="juno.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    ids: {
      production: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai"
    },
    source: "dist",
    precompress: {
      mode: "replace"
    }
  }
});
```

#### Choose the compression algorithm

By default, precompression uses **Gzip** (`algorithm: "gzip"`) because it offers a good balance between compression speed, compatibility, and size.

You can switch to **Brotli** (`algorithm: "brotli"`) for potentially smaller files, especially for text-based assets such as those compressed by default like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

```javascript title="juno.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    ids: {
      production: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai"
    },
    source: "dist",
    precompress: {
      algorithm: "brotli"
    }
  }
});
```

#### Use multiple rules

:::tip

This strategy works great for modern static sites.

:::

In some cases, particularly when using `mode: replace`, you may want to apply different precompression strategies depending on the file type. For example, using replace for JavaScript and CSS files, but doing so for HTML can break social media previews.

To handle this, the precompress option also accepts an array of rules:

```javascript title="juno.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    ids: {
      production: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai"
    },
    source: "dist",
    precompress: [
      {
        pattern: "**/*.+(js|mjs|css)",
        algorithm: "brotli",
        mode: "replace"
      },
      {
        pattern: "**/*.html",
        algorithm: "brotli",
        mode: "both"
      }
    ]
  }
});
```
