Headers allow the client and the satellite to pass additional information along with a request or a response. Some sets of headers can affect how the browser handles the page and its content.

For instance, you may want to set a specific `Cache-Control` for performance reasons.

Here's an example of the `headers` object:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    id: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai",
    source: "dist",
    storage: {
      headers: [
        {
          source: "/",
          headers: [["Cache-Control", "public,max-age=0,must-revalidate"]]
        },
        {
          source: "assets/fonts/*",
          headers: [["Cache-Control", "max-age=31536000"]]
        },
        {
          source: "**/*.jpg",
          headers: [
            ["Cache-Control", "max-age=31536000"],
            ["Access-Control-Allow-Origin", "*"]
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
  }
});
```

This `source` attribute works similarly to Git's `.gitignore`, and you can specify which files match the headers using globs.

The `headers` is an array of objects, each containing `key` and `value`, and these apply to the matching paths.

:::note

- The `Content-Type` header is calculated automatically and cannot be altered.
- No validation or check for uniqueness is performed. For example, if a header matches a file based on multiple rules, multiple headers will be set.
- Likewise, if you provide the same header when you [upload](https://juno.build/docs/build/storage#upload-asset) file to your "Storage" and within the configuration, both headers will be set in the response.
