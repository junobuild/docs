The `source` field specifies the directory that contains the built assets for your satellite. This is typically the output directory generated by your build process after running a command like `npm run build`.

import Examples from "./source-examples.mdx";

<Examples />

Juno uses this directory to locate the files that will be deployed as part of your satellite. Ensure that this directory includes all the necessary assets, such as HTML, JavaScript, CSS, and any other static or dynamic resources your application requires.

```javascript title="juno.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    ids: {
      production: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai"
    },
    source: "dist"
  }
});
```
