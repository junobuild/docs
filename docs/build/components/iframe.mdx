For security reasons and to prevent click-jacking attacks, dapps deployed with Juno are, by default, set to deny embedding in other sites.

You can customize this behavior by setting the `iframe` option to either `same-origin`, which restricts your pages to be displayed only if all ancestor frames have the same origin as the page itself, or `allow-any`, which allows your project to be embeddable by any site.

```javascript title="juno.config.js"
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    ids: {
      production: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai"
    },
    source: "dist",
    storage: {
      iframe: "same-origin"
    }
  }
});
```
