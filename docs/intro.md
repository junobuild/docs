# Getting started

Welcome to Juno, an open-source Blockchain-as-a-Service platform that empowers developers to build decentralized apps more efficiently than ever before ðŸš€ðŸ¤¯.

Unlike traditional Web2 platforms like Google Firebase or AWS Amplify, Juno operates entirely on the blockchain. This means you can delegate the complexities of web or mobile development on Web3, allowing you to focus solely on the frontend.

Our unique approach ensures that you retain full control over your data and work. With Juno, your creations remain truly your own.

## Launching with Juno

To begin with Juno, launch your first [Satellite](/docs/add-juno-to-an-app/create-a-satellite.md) â€“ a feature-packed smart contract for your project.

This all-in-one container provides authentication, datastore (a key-pair store akin to a simple "database"), file storage, serverless functions and hosting capabilities.

## Starting a new project

Are you embarking on a new project? We've got your back.

Whether you're aiming to create a website, blog, or application, leverage Juno's onboarding CLI to scaffold your project. Our ready-made templates are developed with the most well-known frontend frameworks, including Astro, Next.js, React, SvelteKit, Vue, and Angular.

Just run

```bash
npm create juno@latest
```

...and follow the prompts.

:::note

Our CLI tool is compatible with Mac, Linux, and Windows and requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) to be installed. It also supports Yarn and pnpm.

## Integrating in an existing app

Juno is designed to be framework-agnostic, allowing for seamless integration with any modern frontend framework or even in projects without one. To ensure a smooth integration that aligns with your preferred technology stack, explore our [guides and examples](/docs/category/guides-and-examples).

## Local development

Unsure about launching satellites in production? Primarily interested in local development?

Try our [local development emulator](./miscellaneous/local-development.md). It allows you to build and test your projects in an environment that closely mirrors production, without the commitment of a live deployment.

:::tip

The emulator is available with all starting templates. Try `npm create juno@latest`.
