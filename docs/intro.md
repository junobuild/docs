# Getting Started

To begin with Juno, launch your first [Satellite](/docs/add-juno-to-an-app/create-a-satellite.md) â€“ a feature-packed smart contract for your project.

This all-in-one container provides authentication, datastore (a key-pair store akin to a simple "database"), file storage, serverless functions and hosting capabilities.

## Starting a new project

Are you embarking on a new project? We've got your back.

Whether you're aiming to create a website, blog, or application, leverage Juno's onboarding CLI to scaffold your project. Our ready-made templates are developed with the most well-known frontend frameworks, including Astro, Next.js, React, SvelteKit, Vue, and Angular.

Just run

```bash
npm create juno@latest
```

...and follow the prompts.

:::note

Our CLI tool is compatible with Mac, Linux, and Windows and requires [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en) to be installed. It also supports Yarn and pnpm.

## Integrating in an existing app

After creating your satellite, you're ready to put it to use. Follow our [step-by-step guidance](./add-juno-to-an-app/setup) to install the SDK and initialize your app, establishing communication with your satellite.

## Local development

Unsure about launching satellites in production? Primarily interested in local development?

Try our [local development emulator](./guides/local-development.md). It allows you to build and test your projects in an environment that closely mirrors production, without the commitment of a live deployment.

:::tip

The emulator is available with all starting templates. Run `npm create juno@latest` to start a new project.
