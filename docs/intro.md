# Getting started

Welcome to Juno, an open-source Blockchain-as-a-Service platform that empowers developers to build decentralized apps more efficiently than ever before ðŸš€ðŸ¤¯.

Unlike traditional Web2 platforms like Google Firebase or AWS Amplify, Juno operates entirely on the blockchain. This means you can delegate the complexities of web or mobile development on Web3, allowing you to focus solely on the frontend.

Our unique approach ensures that you retain full control over your data and work. With Juno, your creations remain truly your own.

## Launching with Juno

To begin with Juno, launch your first [Satellite](/docs/add-juno-to-an-app/create-a-satellite.md) â€“ a feature-packed smart contract for your project.

This all-in-one container provides authentication, datastore (a key-pair store akin to a simple "database"), file storage, serverless functions and hosting capabilities.

## Having a preferred frameworks?

Juno is framework-agnostic and can be easily integrated with all modern frontend frameworks or even used without one. Follow our quick start [guides and examples](/docs/category/guides-and-examples) to stay true to your favorite stack.

## Build

Develop and launch your project with the help of our comprehensive set of features:

- [Authentication](build/authentication.md)
- [Datastore](build/datastore.md)
- [Storage](build/storage.md)
- [Hosting](build/hosting.md)
- [Analytics](build/analytics.md)

## Learn concepts

Familiarize yourself with Juno's [infrastructure](category/infrastructure) and [architecture](architecture.md) to gain a better understanding of its operation.
