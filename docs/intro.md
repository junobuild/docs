# Getting started

Welcome to Juno, an open-source Blockchain-as-a-Service platform that empowers developers to build decentralized apps more efficiently than ever before ðŸš€ðŸ¤¯.

Unlike traditional Web2 platforms like Google Firebase or AWS Amplify, Juno operates entirely on the blockchain. This means you can delegate the complexities of web or mobile development on Web3, allowing you to focus solely on the frontend.

Our unique approach ensures that you retain full control over your data and work. With Juno, your creations remain truly your own.

## Add Juno to your JavaScript project

To get started with Juno, launch your first [satellite](/docs/add-juno-to-an-app/create-a-satellite.md) â€“ a smart contract container packed with features for your project, and integrate our JavaScript SDK into your project.

## Having a preferred frameworks?

Juno is framework-agnostic and can be easily integrated with all modern frontend frameworks or even used without one. Follow our quick start [guides and examples](/docs/category/guides-and-examples) to stay true to your favorite stack.

## Build

Develop and launch your project with the help of our comprehensive set of features:

- [Authentication](build/authentication.md)
- [Datastore](build/datastore.md)
- [Storage](build/storage.md)
- [Hosting](build/hosting.md)
- [Analytics](build/analytics.md)

## Learn concepts

Familiarize yourself with Juno's [infrastructure](category/infrastructure) and [architecture](architecture.md) to gain a better understanding of its operation.
