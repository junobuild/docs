# Start a New Project

With Juno, a project typically lives in a single repository — combining your frontend, serverless functions, and configuration. Whether you're starting from scratch or extending an existing app, the result is a full-stack project that deploys as a single container.

Choose the path that fits where you are in your journey:

---

## 🚀 1. Scaffold with a Juno Template

One way to get started is by scaffolding a full-stack project using our prebuilt templates — it sets up your frontend framework of choice along with serverless functions and emulator support.

To create a new project, just run:

import { Bash } from "./components/bash.mdx";

<Bash
  npm="npm create juno@latest"
  yarn="yarn create juno"
  pnpm="pnpm create juno"
/>

:::note
Supports Astro, Next.js, React, SvelteKit, Vue, and Angular.

## ✨ 2. Start with Your Favorite Framework

Prefer to begin with `npx create-next-app`, `npm create svelte@latest`, or any other starter you know well? Totally fine. Set up your frontend however you like, then bring in Juno afterward.

:::tip[SSR not supported]

Juno doesn’t yet support Server Side Rendering (SSR). Your frontend code should run on the client side. We recommend using Static Site Generation (SSG) or prerendering instead.

:::

Once your app is ready, head over to the [SDK Setup Guide](./setup-the-sdk.mdx) to:

- Install the SDK
- Enable emulator support
- Add serverless functions
- Configure deployment

This gives you full flexibility while keeping everything in one repo.

## 🧩 3. Add Juno to an Existing Project

Already have a project in development or production? You can integrate Juno incrementally.

Start with the [SDK Setup Guide](./setup-the-sdk.mdx) and bring in only what you need — whether that's authentication, datastore, serverless functions, or all of the above.

---

## One Repo, One App

No matter how you start, Juno follows a simple principle: **one project = one repo = one container**.

Everything — frontend, backend, and app state — is bundled into a single WebAssembly (WASM) container and deployed together.

This architecture keeps development and deployment straightforward, reliable, and fully yours.
