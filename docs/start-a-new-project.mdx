# Start a new project

Are you starting a fresh project? We've got your back.

Whether it's a website, blog, or app, leverage Juno's onboarding CLI to scaffold your project with ready-made templates for popular frontend frameworks like Astro, Next.js, React, SvelteKit, Vue, and Angular.

Just run:

import { Bash } from "./components/bash.mdx";

<Bash
  npm="npm create juno@latest"
  yarn="yarn create juno"
  pnpm="pnpm create juno"
/>

...and follow the prompts.

This will generate a working project with:

- A frontend app using your selected framework
- Preconfigured emulator support
- Sample serverless functions (TypeScript or Rust)
- Built-in auth, data, and storage integration
- Or a minimal template if you just want to host a static site

You can run the project locally right away, explore the code, and start building.
