# Local Development

The tooling is designed with local-first development in mind. Whether you're using the official [plugins](../reference/plugins.md) (Next.js, Vite) or creating a new project with `npm create juno@latest`, local development is the default experience.

When running `npm run dev` (or `start`), your app connects to a locally simulated Satellite via the provided emulator — so you can build and test your backend logic without deploying to the live network.

For continuous integration workflows or advanced setups, this guide shows how to run a Docker-based sandbox that closely mirrors the production environment.

---

## Before you begin

Make sure you have Docker installed on your machine ([Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), [MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)).

:::note

For MacBooks with M processors, it is important to use Docker Desktop version 4.25.0 or later, ideally the latest available version.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to run the local developer environment is through the CLI.

If you haven’t installed it yet, run:

import Cli from "./components/cli.mdx";

<Cli />

Then, in your project folder, start the local emulator with:

```bash
juno dev start
```

This will launch a local Satellite along with a local Internet Identity, allowing you to develop and test without deploying anything live.

We recommend running this in a dedicated terminal window or tab, while your frontend project (e.g. using Vite or Next.js) runs separately using npm run dev or similar.

To stop the emulator, run:

```bash
juno dev stop
```

---

## Hot Reload

The local container supports live reloading. When you modify your [configuration](#configuration) or build custom [Functions](../build/functions/index.md) to enhance Juno's capabilities with serverless features, those changes will be automatically redeployed.

---

## Options

Modify the following information of the `docker-compose.yml` file to tweak the container behavior to your needs:

### Ports

The default port `5987` is used for communication with the locally deployed satellites and other modules in the local environment (replica). This is the primary port for interaction with the application.

The container also exposes a small admin server for internal management on port `5999`.

If you want to use a different port, such as 8080, update for example the mapping from `5987:5987` to `8080:5987`, where the first value (8080) is the port you can call, and the second (5987) is the actual container port.

### Volumes

The image requires a volume to preserve its state. This ensures that when you stop and restart your container, it will resume with the previous state - for instance, if you persist data in its Datastore or Storage, those files will be retained.

The Docker Compose feature automatically creates the volume, so all you need to do is specify it once.

Naming the volume is particularly useful when developing multiple dApps locally, as it allows you to maintain separate states for each project.

Replace `my_dapp` in the configuration with another volume name to suit your needs.

For example, if you are developing a "Hello World" project, you could change the volume name to "hello_world".

```yml title="docker-compose.yml"
services:
  juno-satellite:
    image: junobuild/satellite:latest
    ports:
      - 5987:5987
      - 5999:5999
    volumes:
      - hello_world:/juno/.juno # <-------- hello_world modified here
      - ./juno.dev.config.json:/juno/juno.dev.config.json
      - ./target/deploy:/juno/target/deploy/

volumes:
  hello_world: # <-------- and here
```

---

## Configuration

The behavior of the Satellite running in the Docker container can be configured with the help of a local configuration file commonly named `juno.dev.config.json`.

This configuration file enables you to define the collections of the Datastore and Storage that run locally, but it also allows for defining additional controllers for your satellite.

The definition is as follows:

```typescript
export type PermissionText = "public" | "private" | "managed" | "controllers";
export type MemoryText = "heap" | "stable";
export type RulesType = "db" | "storage";

export interface Rule {
  collection: string;
  read: PermissionText;
  write: PermissionText;
  memory: MemoryText;
  createdAt?: bigint;
  updatedAt?: bigint;
  maxSize?: number;
  maxCapacity?: number;
  mutablePermissions: boolean;
  maxTokens?: number;
}

export type SatelliteDevDbCollection = Omit<
  Rule,
  "createdAt" | "updatedAt" | "maxSize"
>;

export type SatelliteDevStorageCollection = Omit<
  Rule,
  "createdAt" | "updatedAt" | "maxCapacity"
>;

export interface SatelliteDevCollections {
  db?: SatelliteDevDbCollection[];
  storage?: SatelliteDevStorageCollection[];
}

export interface SatelliteDevController {
  id: string;
  scope: "write" | "admin";
}

export interface SatelliteDevConfig {
  collections: SatelliteDevCollections;
  controllers?: SatelliteDevController[];
}

export interface JunoDevConfig {
  satellite: SatelliteDevConfig;
}
```

### Example

If, for example, we want to configure a "metadata" collection in the Datastore, a "content" collection in the Storage, and provide an additional controller, we could use the following configuration:

```json title="juno.dev.config.json"
{
  "satellite": {
    "collections": {
      "db": [
        {
          "collection": "metadata",
          "read": "managed",
          "write": "managed",
          "memory": "stable",
          "mutablePermissions": true
        }
      ],
      "storage": [
        {
          "collection": "content",
          "read": "public",
          "write": "public",
          "memory": "stable",
          "mutablePermissions": true
        }
      ]
    },
    "controllers": [
      {
        "id": "535yc-uxytb-gfk7h-tny7p-vjkoe-i4krp-3qmcl-uqfgr-cpgej-yqtjq-rqe",
        "scope": "admin"
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Path and name

The configuration can be placed in a location other than next to the compose file and can be named whatever suits your needs. If you do so, make sure to adapt the compose file accordingly.

```yml title="docker-compose.yml"
services:
  juno-satellite:
    image: junobuild/satellite:latest
    ports:
      - 5987:5987
      - 5999:5999
    volumes:
      - my_dapp:/juno/.juno
      - /your/custom/path/your_config_file.json:/juno/juno.dev.config.json # <-------- Modify location and file name of the left hand part

volumes:
  my_dapp:
```

## Usage

During local development, your app connects to the local emulator (container) by default — no extra configuration needed.

This is handled automatically when using the [plugins](../reference/plugins.md), or when starting from a template.

If needed, you can opt out of the container behavior by explicitly setting `container: false`.

### Manual Initialization

If you're not using a plugin and are initializing Juno manually, here's how to configure it to use the local container:

```javascript
import { initSatellite } from "@junobuild/core";

const container = import.meta.env.DEV === true;

await initSatellite({
  satelliteId: container
    ? "jx5yt-yyaaa-aaaal-abzbq-cai"
    : "aaaaa-bbbbb-ccccc-ddddd-cai",
  container
});
```

The SDK will automatically detect the container in local development. If you want to disable that behavior and connect directly to a remote canister (e.g. in CI or production testing), you can do:

```javascript
await initSatellite({
  satelliteId: "aaaaa-bbbbb-ccccc-ddddd-cai",
  container: false
});
```

---

## Administration

The admin server running on port `5999` provides a variety of internal management. Below are some tips and example scripts to make use of this little server.

### Get ICP

You might want to transfer some ICP from the ledger to a specified principal, which can be particularly useful when you're just getting started developing your app and no users currently own ICP. This can be achieved by querying:

```
http://localhost:5999/ledger/transfer/?to=$PRINCIPAL
```

For example, you can use the following script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Check if a principal is passed as an argument; otherwise, prompt for it
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  read -r -p "Enter the Wallet ID (owner account, principal): " PRINCIPAL
else
  PRINCIPAL=$1
fi

# Make a transfer request to the admin server
curl "http://localhost:5999/ledger/transfer/?to=$PRINCIPAL"
```

## Tips and Tricks

In the local environment, several modules (also known as "canisters" on the Internet Computer) are automatically spun up. This ensures that developers have everything they need to start building right out of the box. Thanks to built-in plugins and tooling, these modules are automatically integrated into the environment, eliminating the need for devs to manually manage their bindings.

However, in some cases, it may be useful to explicitly reference module IDs. Below is a list of the modules and their respective IDs that are automatically mounted.

:::note

Except for the Satellite ID, which differs from your production environment, all other IDs match the actual smart contract IDs on the mainnet.
