# Local Development

Juno offers something most platforms don‚Äôt: a full local development environment that closely mirrors production.

When you develop locally, you're running an emulator that includes the well known infrastructure services ‚Äî including the actual administration Console UI.

This enables:

- A development experience that mirrors mainnet, helping you build with confidence
- A smooth dev loop, from prototype to deployment
- A unique way to build, debug, and validate smart contract logic and frontend behavior ‚Äî all in one place

## Before you begin

Docker is used to run a self-contained local environment with all services, replicas, and the Console UI.

Make sure the tool is installed on your machine ([Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/windows-install/), [MacOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/mac-install/), or [Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/)).

:::note

For MacBooks with M processors, it is important to use Docker Desktop version 4.25.0 or later, ideally the latest available version.

:::

---

## Getting Started

The easiest way to run the local developer environment is through the CLI.

If you haven‚Äôt installed it yet, run:

import Cli from "./components/cli.mdx";

<Cli />

Then, in your project folder, start the local emulator with:

```bash
juno dev start
```

This will launch the emulator along with all the services needed to develop your project.

We recommend running this in a dedicated terminal window or tab, while your frontend project (e.g. using Vite or Next.js) runs separately using npm run dev or similar.

To stop the emulator, run:

```bash
juno dev stop
```

## Available Images

Juno supports two main environments for running your project locally, each tailored to different use cases.

| Image                 | Description                                  | Includes Console UI | Best for                    |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `junobuild/skylab`    | All-in-one local environment like production | ‚úÖ                  | End-to-end dev, exploration |
| `junobuild/satellite` | Lightweight setup running a single Satellite | ‚ùå                  | CI, focused app testing     |

Both variants run on a local network, services and support live-reloading for serverless functions written in Rust or TypeScript.

- Use **Skylab** for the full experience, including the Console UI and supporting infrastructure.
- Use **Satellite** when you want a faster, minimal setup for a specific app or automated tests.

The table below shows which modules are available in each image and helps clarify what‚Äôs included when running locally with Skylab or Satellite.

| Module                                      | Skylab ‚úÖ | Satellite ‚úÖ |
| ------------------------------------------- | --------- | ------------ |
| Console (Backend)                           | ‚úÖ        | ‚ùå           |
| Console (UI)                                | ‚úÖ        | ‚ùå           |
| Create Satellites / Orbiters via Console UI | ‚úÖ        | ‚ùå           |
| Default (auto-deployed) Satellite           | ‚ùå        | ‚úÖ           |
| Observatory                                 | ‚úÖ        | ‚ùå           |
| Internet Identity                           | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ           |
| ICP Ledger                                  | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ           |
| ICP Index                                   | ‚úÖ        | ‚úÖ           |
| NNS Governance                              | ‚úÖ        | ‚ùå           |
| Cycles Minting (CMC)                        | ‚úÖ        | ‚ùå           |

:::note

The default (auto-deployed) Satellite is available with a predefined canister ID `jx5yt-yyaaa-aaaal-abzbq-cai`.

## Hot Reload

The local container supports live reloading. When you modify your [configuration](../reference/emulator/satellite#configuration) or build custom [Functions](../build/functions/index.md) to enhance Juno's capabilities with serverless features, those changes will be automatically redeployed.

---

## Configuration Options

To customize the behavior of the local emulator‚Äîsuch as changing ports, setting a persistent volume name, or overriding the runner image ‚Äî refer to the [Emulator Configuration](../reference/configuration.mdx#emulator-configuration) section.

There you'll find detailed information about available options including:

- ‚öôÔ∏è Runner settings (e.g. image, platform, volume)
- üîå Custom port mappings
- üìÅ Shared folders and hot reloading
- üß™ CI and test environment tips

---

## Usage

During local development, your app connects to the local emulator (container) by default ‚Äî no extra configuration needed.

This is handled automatically when using the [plugins](../reference/plugins.mdx), or when starting from a template.

If needed, you can opt out of the container behavior by explicitly setting `container: false`.

### Manual Initialization

If you're not using a plugin and are initializing Juno manually, here's how to configure it to use the local container:

```javascript
import { initSatellite } from "@junobuild/core";

const container = import.meta.env.DEV === true;

await initSatellite({
  satelliteId: container
    ? "jx5yt-yyaaa-aaaal-abzbq-cai"
    : "aaaaa-bbbbb-ccccc-ddddd-cai",
  container
});
```

The SDK will automatically detect the container in local development. If you want to disable that behavior and connect directly to a remote canister (e.g. in CI or production testing), you can do:

```javascript
await initSatellite({
  satelliteId: "aaaaa-bbbbb-ccccc-ddddd-cai",
  container: false
});
```

---

## Administration

The admin server running on port `5999` provides a variety of internal management. Below are some tips and example scripts to make use of this little server.

### Get ICP

If you're using the full environment, the Console UI includes a "Get ICP" button in the wallet. It‚Äôs a quick way to get ICP out of the box.

![A screenshot of the wallet with the Get ICP call to action of Console UI in dev mode](../img/dev-console/wallet.webp)

You might want to transfer some ICP from the ledger to a specified principal, which can be particularly useful when you're just getting started developing your app and no users currently own ICP. This can be achieved by querying:

```
http://localhost:5999/ledger/transfer/?to=$PRINCIPAL
```

For example, you can use the following script:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Check if a principal is passed as an argument; otherwise, prompt for it
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
  read -r -p "Enter the Wallet ID (owner account, principal): " PRINCIPAL
else
  PRINCIPAL=$1
fi

# Make a transfer request to the admin server
curl "http://localhost:5999/ledger/transfer/?to=$PRINCIPAL"
```
