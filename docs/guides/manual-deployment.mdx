# Manual Deployment

We recommend using [GitHub Actions](./github-actions.mdx) for automated and efficient deployments. However, this guide walks you through manually deploying your app using the Juno CLI, covering the setup, build, and deployment process to your Juno Satellite.

---

### 1. Install Juno CLI

Install the Juno command line interface by executing the following command in your terminal:

import Cli from "./components/cli.mdx";

<Cli />

---

### 2. Initialization

Once the CLI is set up, initialize your project by running:

```bash
juno init
```

This command generates a configuration file and prompts you to log in to your Satellite from the terminal to authenticate your device.

Upon execution, Juno’s Console will open in your browser, where you’ll be asked to grant permissions for your modules. These include Mission Control (your wallet), Satellite(s), and Analytics, allowing secure access from your machine.

:::info

If the login process opens in a different browser than the one where you're already signed into, simply copy the URL and paste it into your authenticated browser to continue.

This can occur if you've signed into the Juno Console in a browser other than your system's default.

:::

### 3. Deploy

Build your project:

import { Bash } from "../components/bash.mdx";

<Bash npm="npm run build" yarn="yarn build" pnpm="pnpm build" />

Deploy your application or website by running the following command from your project’s root folder:

```bash
juno deploy
```

:::tip

When prompted for the name or path of the folder containing your built dapp files, provide the appropriate folder name for your framework, such as `build` (SvelteKit), `out` (Next.js), or `dist` (React, Astro, or Vue).

:::

Wait for the deploy to complete. Once uploaded, it will be live on your Juno Satellite and accessible on the web.
