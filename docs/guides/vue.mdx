### Step-by-step

This guide provides quickstart instructions for integrating Juno in two scenarios: starting a new project and adding Juno to an existing Vue app.

Additionally, it covers how to develop against a production environment or locally.

#### 1. Choose Your Integration Path

You can either start a new project or add Juno to an existing app.

##### Path A: Start a new project with a template

Create a new project using the Juno quickstart CLI:

```bash
npm create juno@latest -- --template nextjs-starter
```

##### Path B: Integrate Juno into an existing Vue app

Navigate to your existing app directory and install Juno SDK:

```bash
cd your-existing-app
npm i @junobuild/core
```

#### 2. Configure Datastore

##### Production Path

To use production, set up a satellite and new collection:

- [Create a new satellite](../create-a-satellite.md) in the Juno's console.
- After your project is ready, create a collection in your datastore, which we'll call `demo`, using the [console](https://console.juno.build).

##### Local Development Path

To develop with the local emulator, add a collection named `demo` within the `juno.dev.config.ts` file.

```typescript
import { defineDevConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineDevConfig(() => ({
  satellite: {
    collections: {
      db: [
        {
          collection: "demo",
          read: "managed" as const,
          write: "managed" as const,
          memory: "stable" as const,
          mutablePermissions: true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}));
```

- Once set, run the local emulator:

```bash
juno dev start
```

- If the Juno admin CLI (required for deployment, configuration, or to run the emulator) is not installed yet, run:

```
npm i -g @junobuild/cli
```

#### 3. Insert data from your app

In `App.vue`, initialize the library with the satellite ID you have created for production, or use `jx5yt-yyaaa-aaaal-abzbq-cai` if you are developing locally with the emulator.

Add an `insert` function to persist a document.

```html title="App.vue"
<script setup>
  import { initSatellite, setDoc } from "@junobuild/core";
  import { onMounted, ref } from "vue";

  onMounted(async () => await initSatellite());

  const doc = ref(undefined);

  const insert = async () => {
    doc.value = await setDoc({
      collection: "demo",
      doc: {
        key: `my-key-${new Date().getTime()}`,
        data: {
          hello: "world"
        }
      }
    });
  };
</script>

<template>
  <button @click="insert">Insert a document</button>
  <span v-if="doc !== undefined">Key: {{ doc.key }}</span>
</template>
```

#### 4. Start the app

Start the app, go to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) in a browser, click "Insert a document," and you should see the data successfully persisted in your satellite on the blockchain.

import WhatsNext from "./components/whats-next.md";

### Quickstart

This example demonstrates how to quickly deploy a basic note-taking app that integrates Juno's core features:

- [Authentication](../build/authentication.md): easy-to-use SDKs that support truly anonymous authentication.
- [Datastore](../build/datastore.md): a simple key-pair database for storing user data and other information.
- [Storage](../build/storage.md): a file storage system to store and serve user-generated content, such as photos.

Using the Juno CLI, you can easily scaffold this app. To start, run the appropriate command based on your package manager:

NPM:

```bash
npm create juno@latest -- --template vue-example
```

Yarn:

```bash
yarn create juno -- --template vue-example
```

PNPM:

```bash
pnpm create juno -- --template vue-example
```

<br />
Follow the CLI prompts to choose the note-taking app example and select local
development. The CLI will manage all configurations and dependencies, allowing
you to focus on exploring and customizing your app right away.

## Hosting

If you already have an [Vue](https://vuejs.org/) app, you're all set — proceed to the [Deployment](#deployment) section to upload your project to production.

Otherwise, you can bootstrap a new website using the Juno template by running the following command:

```bash
npm create juno@latest -- --template vue-starter
```

Once you’re set up, continue to the [Deployment](#deployment) section below.

## Deployment

Use this guide to deploy your project to production — directly to a smart contract on mainnet.

import Deploy from "./components/deploy.mdx";

<Deploy index={1} />

[satellite]: ../terminology.md#satellite
