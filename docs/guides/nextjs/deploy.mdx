# Deploy a Next.js App

Use this guide to deploy and host your project to production.

## 1. Static exports

The Internet Computer, including Juno, currently does not support Server Side Rendering (_without workaround_). Therefore, it is recommended to generate a pre-rendered or client-side-only frontend application.

We suggest using the [static exports](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) option from Next.js.

:::note

If you’re using the official Juno [Next.js plugin](../reference/plugins.mdx#nextjs-plugin), static exports are already configured for you.

:::

In `next.config.js` file:

```javascript title="next.config.js"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: "export"
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

import CreateSatellite from "../components/create-satellite.mdx";

<CreateSatellite index={2} />

## 3. Configure your project

Create a `juno.config.mjs` file at the root of your project, and replace the `PROD_SATELLITE_ID` with the ID of the Satellite you created earlier.

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

/** @type {import('@junobuild/config').JunoConfig} */
export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    ids: {
      development: "<DEV_SATELLITE_ID>",
      production: "<PROD_SATELLITE_ID>"
    },
    source: "out",
    predeploy: ["npm run build"]
  }
});
```

import Deploy from "../components/deploy.mdx";

<Deploy index={4} />
