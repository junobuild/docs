# Code Functions in TypeScript

Learn how to develop, integrate, and extend Juno Satellites with serverless functions written in TypeScript.

---

## Quickstart

import Setup from "./components/setup.mdx";

<Setup />

In a new terminal window, kick off the emulator (requires Docker):

```bash
juno dev start --watch
```

Now, your local development environment is up and running, ready for you to start coding.

Every time you make changes to your code, it will automatically recompile and reload.
