# Code Functions in TypeScript

Learn how to develop, integrate, and extend Juno Satellites with serverless functions written in TypeScript.

---

## Quickstart

import Setup from "./components/functions/setup.mdx";

<Setup />

In a new terminal window, kick off the emulator (requires Docker):

```bash
juno dev start --watch
```

Now, your local development environment is up and running, ready for you to start coding.

Every time you make changes to your code, it will automatically recompile and reload.

---

## Hooks and Data Operations

import Hooks from "./components/functions/hooks.md";

<Hooks />

Now, let's create a hook within `src/satellite/index.ts` with the following implementation:

```typescript
import { defineHook, type OnSetDoc } from "@junobuild/functions";
import {
  decodeDocData,
  encodeDocData,
  setDocStore
} from "@junobuild/functions/sdk";

// The data shape stored in the Satellite's Datastore
interface Person {
  hello: string;
}

// We declare a hook that listens to changes in the "demo" collection
export const onSetDoc = defineHook<OnSetDoc>({
  collections: ["demo"],
  run: async (context) => {
    // Decode the document's data (stored as a blob)
    const data = decodeDocData<Person>(context.data.data.after.data);

    // Update the document's data by enhancing the "hello" field
    const updated = {
      hello: `${data.hello} checked`
    };

    // Encode the data back to blob format
    const encoded = encodeDocData(updated);

    // Save the updated document using the same caller, collection, and key
    await setDocStore({
      caller: context.caller,
      collection: context.data.collection,
      key: context.data.key,
      doc: {
        data: encoded,
        description: context.data.data.after.description,
        version: context.data.data.after.version
      }
    });
  }
});
```

Once saved, your code should be automatically compiled and deployed.

When testing this feature, if you wait a bit before calling the getter, you should now receive the modified "hello: world checked" text set by the hook. This delay occurs because serverless Functions execute fully asynchronously, separate from the request-response cycle between your frontend and the Satellite.
