### Step-by-step

This guide provides quickstart instructions for integrating Juno in two scenarios: starting a new project and adding Juno to an existing Next.js app.

Additionally, it covers how to develop against a production environment or locally.

#### 1. Choose Your Integration Path

You can either start a new project or add Juno to an existing app.

##### Path A: Start a new project with a template

Create a new project using the Juno quickstart CLI:

```bash
npm create juno@latest -- --template nextjs-starter
```

##### Path B: Integrate Juno into an existing Next.js app

Navigate to your existing app directory and install Juno SDK:

```bash
cd your-existing-app
npm i @junobuild/core-peer
```

#### 2. Configure Datastore

##### Production Path

To use production, set up a satellite and new collection:

- [Create a new satellite](../create-a-satellite.md) in the Juno's console.
- After your project is ready, create a collection in your datastore, which we'll call `demo`, using the [console](https://console.juno.build).

##### Local Development Path

To develop with the local emulator, add a collection named `demo` within the `juno.dev.config.ts` file.

```typescript
import { defineDevConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineDevConfig(() => ({
  satellite: {
    collections: {
      db: [
        {
          collection: "demo",
          read: "managed" as const,
          write: "managed" as const,
          memory: "stable" as const,
          mutablePermissions: true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}));
```

- Once set, run the local emulator:

```bash
juno dev start
```

- If the Juno admin CLI (required for deployment, configuration, or to run the emulator) is not installed yet, run:

```
npm i -g @junobuild/cli
```

#### 3. Insert data from your app

In `Page.tsx`, (if using TypeScript) or the corresponding JavaScript file, initialize the library with the satellite ID you have created for production, or use `jx5yt-yyaaa-aaaal-abzbq-cai` if you are developing locally with the emulator.

Add an `insert` function to persist a document as well.

```typescript title="Page.tsx"
"use client";

import { useEffect, useState } from "react";
import { type Doc, initSatellite, setDoc } from "@junobuild/core-peer";

type Record = {
  hello: string;
};

export default function Home() {
  const [record, setRecord] = useState<Doc<Record> | undefined>(undefined);

  useEffect(() => {
    (async () =>
      await initSatellite())();
  }, []);

  const insert = async () => {
    const doc = await setDoc({
      collection: "demo",
      doc: {
        key: `my-key-${new Date().getTime()}`,
        data: {
          hello: "world",
        },
      },
    });

    setRecord(doc);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <button onClick={insert}>Insert a document</button>
      {record !== undefined && <span>Key: {record.key}</span>}
    </>
  );
}
```

#### 4. Start the app

Start the app and go to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in a browser. Click "Insert a document" to see the data successfully persisted in your satellite on the blockchain.

### Quickstart

This example demonstrates how to quickly deploy a basic note-taking app that integrates Juno's core features:

- [Authentication](../build/authentication.md): easy-to-use SDKs that support truly anonymous authentication.
- [Datastore](../build/datastore.md): a simple key-pair database for storing user data and other information.
- [Storage](../build/storage.md): a file storage system to store and serve user-generated content, such as photos.

Using the Juno CLI, you can easily scaffold this app. To start, run the appropriate command based on your package manager:

NPM:

```bash
npm create juno@latest -- --template nextjs-example
```

Yarn:

```bash
yarn create juno -- --template nextjs-example
```

PNPM:

```bash
pnpm create juno -- --template nextjs-example
```

<br />
Follow the CLI prompts to choose the note-taking app example and select local
development. The CLI will manage all configurations and dependencies, allowing
you to focus on exploring and customizing your app right away.

## Hosting

If you already have an [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) app, you're all set — proceed to the [Deployment](#deployment) section to upload your project to production.

Otherwise, you can bootstrap a new website using the Juno template by running the following command:

```bash
npm create juno@latest -- --template nextjs-starter
```

Once you’re set up, continue to the [Deployment](#deployment) section below.

## Deployment

Use this guide to deploy your project to production — directly to a smart contract on mainnet.

### 1. Static exports

The Internet Computer, including Juno, currently does not support Server Side Rendering (_without workaround_). Therefore, it is recommended to generate a pre-rendered or client-side-only frontend application.

We suggest using the [static exports](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/deploying/static-exports) option from Next.js.

In `next.config.js` file:

```javascript title="next.config.js"
/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  output: "export"
};

module.exports = nextConfig;
```

import Deploy from "./components/deploy.mdx";
