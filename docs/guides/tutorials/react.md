# React

This tutorial demonstrates how to build a basic note-taking app. The app authenticates and identifies the user, stores their notes in a simple key-pair database, some files in storage, and allows the user to log in and retrieve their data. The app uses:

- Juno [datastore](../build/datastore.md): a simple key-pair database for storing user data and other information.
- Juno [storage](../build/storage.md): a file storage system to store and serve user-generated content, such as photos.
- Juno [authentication](../build/authentication.md): easy-to-use SDKs that support truly anonymous authentication.
