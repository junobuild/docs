## Build

This guide provides quickstart instructions for integrating Juno and building a feature-rich application. It also includes guidance on developing in a production environment or locally.

### 1. Choose Your Integration Path

You can either start a new project or add Juno to an existing app.

#### Path A: Start a new project with a template

1. Create a new project using the Juno quickstart CLI:

```bash
npm create juno@latest
```

#### Path B: Integrate Juno into an existing Astro app

1. Add the Juno SDK:

Navigate to your existing app directory and install Juno SDK:

```bash
cd your-existing-app
npm i @junobuild/core
```

### 2. Configure Datastore

#### Production Path

To use production, set up a satellite and new collection:

- [Create a new satellite](../create-a-satellite.md) in the Juno's console.
- After your project is ready, create a collection in your datastore, which we'll call `demo`, using the [console](https://console.juno.build).

#### Local Development Path

To develop with the local emulator, add a collection named `demo` within the `juno.dev.config.mjs` file.

```typescript
import { defineDevConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

/** @type {import('@junobuild/config').JunoDevConfig} */
export default defineDevConfig(() => ({
  satellite: {
    collections: {
      db: [
        {
          collection: "demo",
          read: "managed",
          write: "managed",
          memory: "stable",
          mutablePermissions: true
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}));
```

- Once set, run the local emulator:

```bash
juno dev start
```

- If the Juno admin CLI (required for deployment, configuration, or to run the emulator) is not installed yet, run:

```
npm i -g @junobuild/cli
```

### 3. Insert data from your app

In `index.astro`, initialize the library with the satellite ID you have created for production, or use `jx5yt-yyaaa-aaaal-abzbq-cai` if you are developing locally with the emulator.

Add an `insert` function to persist a document.

```html title="index.astro"
<!doctype html>
<html lang="en">
  <body>
    <main>
      <button id="insert">Insert a document</button>
      <p>Document persisted key: <output id="result"></output></p>

      <script>
        import { initSatellite, setDoc } from "@junobuild/core";

        // Initialize Juno's satellite
        document.addEventListener(
          "DOMContentLoaded",
          async () => {
            await initSatellite();
          },
          { once: true }
        );

        // Insert a document in Juno's datastore
        const insert = async () => {
          const doc = await setDoc({
            collection: "demo",
            doc: {
              key: `my-key-${new Date().getTime()}`,
              data: {
                hello: "world"
              }
            }
          });

          const result = document.querySelector("#result");
          if (result !== null) {
            result.textContent = doc.key;
          }
        };

        document
          .querySelector("#insert")
          ?.addEventListener("click", insert, { passive: true });
      </script>
    </main>
  </body>
</html>
```

### 5. Start the app

Start the app, go to [http://localhost:4321/](http://localhost:4321/) in a browser, click "Insert a document", and you should see the data successfully persisted in your satellite on the blockchain.

:::info[What's Next: Going Live]

If you used the local development path, make sure to configure your collections in the Juno console for production. Once you're ready to deploy your app for others to access, continue to the [Deployment guide](#deployment).

:::

## Hosting

If you already have an [Astro](https://astro.build/) app, you're all set — proceed to the [Deployment](#deployment) section to upload your project to production.

Otherwise, you can bootstrap a new website using the Juno template by running the following command:

```bash
npm create juno@latest -- --template astro-starter
```

Once you’re set up, continue to the [Deployment](#deployment) section below.

## Deployment

Use this guide to deploy your project to production — directly to a smart contract on mainnet.

### 1. Set up a satellite

If you haven't created a satellite yet, go ahead and [create](../create-a-satellite.md) a new one in the Juno's console.

### 2. Deploy

Once your satellite is up and running, you can proceed with uploading your app to your smart contract.

You can either automate your deployment with GitHub Actions (recommended) or deploy manually from your device. Choose your method:

<div style={{display: "flex", gap: "1rem", justifyContent: "center", margin: "2rem 0 2.45rem"}}>
  <Link
    className="button button--hero"
    to="/docs/guides/github-actions#using-github-actions-to-deploy-your-decentralized-app"
  >GitHub Actions</Link>

  <Link
    className="button button--juno"
    to="/docs/guides/manual-deployment"
  >Manual</Link>
</div>
