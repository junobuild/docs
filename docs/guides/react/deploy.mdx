# Deploy a React App

Use this guide to deploy and host your project to production.

## 1. Create a container

import CreateSatellite from "../components/create-satellite.mdx";

<CreateSatellite index={1} />

## 2. Configure your project

Create a `juno.config.ts` file at the root of your project, and replace the `PROD_SATELLITE_ID` with the ID of the Satellite you created earlier.

```typescript
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    ids: {
      development: "<DEV_SATELLITE_ID>",
      production: "<PROD_SATELLITE_ID>"
    },
    source: "dist",
    predeploy: ["npm run build"]
  }
});
```

## 3. How to deploy

import Deploy from "../components/deploy.mdx";

<Deploy index={3} />
