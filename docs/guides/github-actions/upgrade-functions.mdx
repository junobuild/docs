# Upgrade Serverless Functions (Optional)

:::caution

We do not recommend upgrading your container directly from CI in **production**.
This approach hands over control to automation, which may not be suitable for critical environments.
Prefer a change workflow and executing the upgrade with your CLI or in the Console UI.

## Configuration

To configure an action to upgrade your Satellite container, follow these steps:

1. Create an `upgrade.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` subfolder of your repository.
2. Paste the following code into the file:

import Upgrade from "../components/github-actions/upgrade.mdx";

<Upgrade />
