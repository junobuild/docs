# Upgrade Serverless Functions (Optional)

:::caution

We do not recommend upgrading your container directly from CI in **production**.
This approach hands over control to automation, which may not be suitable for critical environments.
Prefer a change workflow and executing the upgrade with your CLI or in the Console UI.
