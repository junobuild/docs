# GitHub Actions

You can leverage the Juno [CLI] to perform tasks within GitHub Actions.

This guide will show you how to use the [junobuild/juno-action](https://github.com/junobuild/juno-action) to deploy your frontend assets, build and publish serverless functions, and optionally upgrade your WASM container.

---

## 1. Add a Secret Token for Automation

Before you can effectively implement automation, it is necessary to add a secret token to your GitHub repository or organization. This token will enable the CI (Continuous Integration) to interact with your [satellite].

Follow the steps below to generate a new controller:

1. Go to the Juno's [console](https://console.juno.build).
2. Select your Satellite.
3. On the Satellite's dashboard, navigate to the "Setup" tab.
4. Click on "Add an access key".
5. Generate a new key (default option) and assign it an appropriate role based on your workflow. [Learn more about the available roles and their permissions](../../miscellaneous/access-keys.md) to choose the appropriate level of access for your use case.
6. Click "Submit".
7. Upon successful creation, a new access key will be generated, and a "Secret token" will be displayed. Copy the token value and save it as an [encrypted secret](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets) in your repository or organization, using the key `JUNO_TOKEN`.

## 2. Configure your project

If you already have a `juno.config` file at the root of your project, you can skip to the next chapter. Otherwise, you need to create one [manually](#configuration-file-example) or by running:

```bash
npx @junobuild/cli init --minimal
```

The configuration file can be a TypeScript, JavaScript, or JSON file (`juno.config.ts`, `juno.config.js|.mjs`, or `juno.config.json`), depending on your preference.

At a minimum, the configuration file must include the following:

- **Satellite ID**: A unique identifier for your Satellite.
- **Source**: The directory containing the built assets for your Satellite. This is typically the output folder of your build process, generated after running a command like `npm run build`.

### Satellite ID

Your Satellite ID can be found in the 'Overview' tab.

### Source

import Examples from "../../build/components/source-examples.mdx";

<Examples />

### Configuration File Example

Here’s an example of configuration file:

```javascript
import { defineConfig } from "@junobuild/config";

export default defineConfig({
  satellite: {
    ids: {
      production: "qsgjb-riaaa-aaaaa-aaaga-cai" // Replace with your satellite ID
    },
    source: "dist", // Replace with your build output directory
    predeploy: ["npm run build"] // Adjust based on your package manager
  }
});
```

For detailed information about all available configuration options, refer to the [configuration](../../reference/configuration.mdx) section.

## 3. Create the GitHub Action

You can use GitHub Actions to automate different parts of your Juno deployment workflow:

- 🪄 Deploy frontend assets to your Satellite. [Learn how.](./deploy-frontend.mdx)
- 🛠️ Build and publish serverless functions (TypeScript or Rust). [Learn how.](./publish-functions.mdx)
- ⚠️ Optionally upgrade your Satellite's WASM container. [Learn how.](./upgrade-functions.mdx)

Each task can be performed independently or combined, depending on your project setup.

## Environment Variables

When using the Actions, you can configure the following environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Mandatory | Description                                                                                                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | --------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `JUNO_TOKEN`         | Yes       | The token to use for authentication. It can be generated through Juno's [Console](https://console.juno.build). Prefer a controller with "Read-write" permission rather than administrator. |
| `PROJECT_PATH`       | No        | The path to the folder containing the `juno.config` file if it doesn't exist at the root of your repository. e.g. `./my-app-subfolder`.                                                    |
