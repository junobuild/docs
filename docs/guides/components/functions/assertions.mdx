    <p>
      Assertions allow you to validate or reject operations before they are executed.
      They're useful for enforcing data integrity, security policies, or business rules
      inside your Satellite, and they run synchronously during the request lifecycle.

    <p>
      This example ensures that any document added to the <code>notes</code> collection does not contain the word <code>"hello"</code> (case-insensitive). If it does, the operation is rejected before the data is saved.
