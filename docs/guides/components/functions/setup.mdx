Set up your environment to develop and extend a Satellite with custom serverless functions.

First, ensure you have the Juno CLI installed. If you haven't installed it yet, run:

import Cli from "../cli.mdx";

<Cli />

At the root of your application, eject the Satellite if you haven't already used a template.

```bash
juno functions eject
```
