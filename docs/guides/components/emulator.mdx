If the Juno admin CLI (required to run the emulator) is not installed yet, run:

```bash
npm i -g @junobuild/cli
```

Once installed, start the local emulator:

```bash
juno dev start
```

Open the Console UI at [http://localhost:5866/](http://localhost:5866/).

:::note

When developing locally, you get an all-in-one emulator that closely mimics the production environment.
This includes providing Juno and its Console UI locally.
