### {props.index}. Set up a satellite

If you haven't created a satellite yet, go ahead and [create](../../create-a-satellite.mdx) a new one in the Juno's console.

### {props.index + 1}. Deploy

Once your satellite is up and running, you can proceed with uploading your app to your smart contract.

You can either automate your deployment with GitHub Actions (recommended) or deploy manually from your device. Choose your method:

<div style={{display: "flex", gap: "1rem", justifyContent: "center", margin: "2rem 0 2.45rem"}}>
  <Link
    className="button button--hero"
    to="/docs/guides/github-actions"
  >GitHub Actions</Link>

  <Link
    className="button button--juno"
    to="/docs/guides/manual-deployment"
  >Manual</Link>
</div>
