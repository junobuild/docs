You can deploy using either [GitHub Actions](#github-actions-deployment) or [CLI](#cli-deployment) (command line interface).

### GitHub Actions deployment

1. From your Satellite's overview, navigate to the **Deployments** page.

2. Click **Connect repository** and follow the steps to register your repository.

3. Create a `deploy.yml` file in the `.github/workflows` subfolder of your repo.

4. Add the following workflow configuration:

import Deploy from "./github-actions/deploy.mdx";

<Deploy />

### CLI deployment

1. Install the CLI

import Cli from "./cli.mdx";

<Cli />

2. Authenticate the CLI. This will open the Juno Console.

```bash
juno login
```

:::tip

An access token is used to identify your terminal. That's why the CLI asks whether you want to encrypt it with a password.
For security reasons, it's recommended that you do so.

3. In the browser window, click **Authorize** to grant permission.

4. Deploy your site:

```bash
juno hosting deploy
```
