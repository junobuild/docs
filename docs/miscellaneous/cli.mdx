# CLI

The Juno CLI provides a variety of tools for managing and deploying projects.

## Installing the Juno CLI

To download and install Juno CLI, run the following command:

```bash
npm i -g @junobuild/cli
```

---

## Administration

Commands dedicated to configuring and managing deployed Satellites, Mission Control, and other modules.

:::tip

The CLI automatically runs in non-interactive mode if either a `JUNO_TOKEN` is set or the `--headless` argument is used.

The former is set when you set up a [GitHub Actions](../guides/github-actions.md).

:::

---

### Login

import Login from "./cli/login.md";

:::important

Authenticating your terminal saves sensitive information on your device. We recommend setting up a password to encrypt this file when prompted.

:::

<Login />

:::note

The authentication process requires a browser.

If you've previously authenticated your terminal and decide to log in again, the CLI will prompt you about reusing your existing identity.

This allows you to reuse your authorization, especially when creating new segments like satellites or orbiters.

:::

#### How does it work?

A new [principal] is generated on your local machine and added as a [controller] of the selected segments. This principal is then used to authenticate any CLI calls made from your terminal to your satellites, mission controls or other modules.

The key is saved in the OS-specific user's variables path.

| OS      | Path                                                                                                 |
| ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Mac     | `~/Library/Preferences/juno-nodejs`                                                                  |
| Windows | `%APPDATA%\juno-nodejs\Config` (for example, `C:\Users\USERNAME\AppData\Roaming\juno-nodejs\Config`) |
| Linux   | `~/.config/juno-nodejs` (or `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/juno-nodejs`)                                          |

### Logout

:::caution

This action currently does not remove the controllers from satellites and/or mission control and/or orbiter. It only logs out your local machine by removing the locally saved key (principal).

:::

import Logout from "./cli/logout.md";

<Logout />

---

### Init

import Init from "./cli/init.md";

<Init />

The `juno init` command creates a `juno.config` file in the root directory of your project.

Depending on your project, it will either create a TypeScript, JavaScript, or JSON file.

:::tip

We recommend using the first two options because they can leverage your IDE's IntelliSense with type hints.

:::

This file is necessary for deploying, configuring, or running any other CLI commands for your app.

Read more about the [configuration](./configuration.md).

---

### Deploy

import Deploy from "./cli/deploy.md";

<Deploy />

---

### Config

import Config from "./cli/config.md";

<Config />

---

### Clear

import Clear from "./cli/clear.md";

<Clear />

:::note

This command removes existing files from the satellite and only affects the app assets. The user's uploaded files will not be cleared as the app is deployed to a reserved collection, `#dapp`.

:::

---

### Upgrade

import Upgrade from "./cli/upgrade.md";

<Upgrade />

:::important

- We recommend that you stay current with the Juno releases, as some features may not perform correctly in the [console](../terminology.md#console) if your smart contracts are outdated.
- Upgrading requires a stable internet connection for a successful process.

:::

The CLI automatically runs in non-interactive mode if either a JUNO_TOKEN is set or the --headless argument is used.

---

## Development

import Dev from "./cli/dev.md";

<Dev />

:::tip

Find more about local development and extending features with serverless functions in the related [guide](../guides/local-development.md).

## Others

Additional commands for managing and interacting with the CLI environment.

---

### Version

import Version from "./cli/version.md";
