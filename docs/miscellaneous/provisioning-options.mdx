# Provisioning Options

The creation wizard for Satellites and Orbiters includes advanced provisioning options for developers who need more control.

### Selecting a Subnet

If you want more control over where your module is provisioned, you can select a [subnet] during the creation process.

Below is a list of available subnets with relevant metadata to help you choose the most appropriate one:

:::note

Satellites and Orbiters running on larger subnets with more nodes will incur higher cycle costs compared to those on the standard 13-node subnets. However, this increased cost comes with the benefit of enhanced security due to the greater size of the subnet.

For most applications, we recommend using the default subnets and staying on the same subnet as Juno.
