# Setup the SDK

To connect your app to a Satellite and use Juno's features — like authentication, data, storage, and serverless functions — you'll need to initialize the SDK.

This guide walks you through how to do that, whether you're using a plugin (Next.js, Vite) or setting things up manually.

:::info

If you intend to use Juno solely for **[hosting](./build/hosting/index.md)** purposes, you may skip the following steps.

:::

---

## TL;DR

1. Call `initSatellite()` in your app code
2. Create a `juno.config` file at the root to define your Satellite
3. Connect code and config — preferably using the `@junobuild/nextjs-plugin` or `@junobuild/vite-plugin`

---

## Initialization

1. Install the Juno SDK:

import Core from "./components/core.mdx";

<Core />

2. Initialize your Satellite in your web app:

```typescript
import { initSatellite } from "@junobuild/core";

await initSatellite();
```

It is generally recommended to initialize globally the library at the top of your application.

---

## Configuration

Juno uses a configuration file to determine which Satellite to connect to.

You can scaffold a minimal `juno.config` file using:

```bash
npx @junobuild/cli init --minimal
```

This creates a `juno.config` file — in TypeScript, JavaScript, or JSON depending on your preferences — at the root of your project. It contains metadata such as the Satellite ID used during SDK initialization.

---

## Connecting Code and Config

If you're using **Next.js** or **Vite**, we recommend installing the official plugin. It automatically loads values from your config file and injects them into your build as environment variables.

This means you can call `initSatellite()` without passing any parameters, the SDK will read them automatically from `process.env` or `import.meta.env`.

- [Next.js Plugin](reference/plugins.mdx#nextjs-plugin)

```javascript title="next.config.js"
import { withJuno } from "@junobuild/nextjs-plugin";

// withJuno wraps your Next.js config and injects values from juno.config
export default withJuno();
```

- [Vite Plugin](reference/plugins.mdx#vite-plugin)

```javascript title="vite.config.js"
import juno from "@junobuild/vite-plugin";

// Automatically injects values from juno.config for the build
export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [juno()]
});
```

:::note

The templates already include both the config file and the plugin setup.

:::

#### Not using a plugin?

You can also pass the Satellite ID manually to the SDK, though using the plugins is the preferred approach:

```typescript
import { initSatellite } from "@junobuild/core";

await initSatellite({
  satelliteId: "your-actual-satellite-id"
});
```
