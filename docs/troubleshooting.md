# Troubleshooting

### Windows Powershell

If you are using Windows Powershell and encounter the following error after installing the [CLI]:

> The term 'juno' is not recognized as a name of a cmdlet, function, script file, or executable program.

Please ensure that npm is added to your system's PATH (e.g. `C:\Users\{PC_NAME}\AppData\Roaming\npm`).

---

### Windows Not Defined

Juno does not support yet Server Side Rendering (see [Roadmap](./white-paper/roadmap.mdx)). Therefore if you are facing such an issue as `ReferenceError: window is not defined` please make sure that your application is not build using SSR.

We generally recommend using Static Site Generation (SSG) / prerendering.

### ReferenceError: global is not defined

The Juno JavaScript libraries rely on the DFINITY [agent-js](https://github.com/dfinity/agent-js/) libraries to interact with the Internet Computer. These libraries require various Node.js polyfills for the browser, which unfortunately make the bundle heavier.

The templates provided by Juno - `npm create juno@latest` - are preconfigured to handle this limitation and issue. However, you might encounter errors if your app bundler is not properly configured. The most common error is global not being available on the client side:

```
ReferenceError: global is not defined

at new Uint8ArrayDecoder (chunk-3K6K3FD6.js?v=df0b7a78:7475:25)

at async _HttpAgent.syncTime (chunk-3K6K3FD6.js?v=df0b7a78:14532:22)
at async Promise.all (:5173/index 0)
```

To resolve this issue, you can configure your bundler to polyfill the required libraries. Since the CLI provides support for most popular frameworks, you might find a proper configuration for your project by referring to the corresponding technology project in this repository: [https://github.com/junobuild/create-juno/tree/main/templates](https://github.com/junobuild/create-juno/tree/main/templates)

### ENOENT: no such file or directory

When encountering the following error after running `juno deploy`, it is likely caused by either not starting the command from the root directory of your project or having an incorrect configuration for the [source](build/hosting/configuration.mdx#source) option, which Juno uses to locate the files for deployment.

> An unexpected error happened ðŸ˜«. Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, scandir ...

Make sure these two requirements are correctly met before restarting the command line.
