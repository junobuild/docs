# Create a Satellite

When you're ready to deploy your project to production, you'll need to create a [Satellite].

1. To get started, sign-in to the Juno [Console](https://console.juno.build).
2. Click **Launch your first Satellite**.
3. Enter a name for your Satellite (note: this is for display purposes only and does not need to be unique).
4. Select whether you're deploying a **Website** or **Application**.
5. Confirm with **Create a Satellite.**
6. The platform will then create your Satellite and provision its resources.
7. Once the process is complete, click **Continue** to access the service page.

🎉 You’re all set! You can now deploy your frontend app, static website, or publish your serverless functions to production.

➡️ Continue with the [deployment](/docs/category/deployment) guides to take the next step.

:::note

Choose **Website** if you're deploying a static site, blog, portfolio, etc.

Choose **Application** if your project needs user sign-in, data management, or serverless functions.

You can change this later in your Satellite "Hosting" settings.
