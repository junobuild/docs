# Create a Satellite

When you're ready to deploy your project to production, you'll need to create a [satellite].

1. To get started, sign-in to the Juno [console](https://console.juno.build). If you are a new developer on Juno and the Internet Computer, you may be prompted to create your first anonymous [Internet Identity].
2. Click **Launch a new Satellite**.
3. Enter a name for your Satellite (note: this is for display purposes only and does not need to be unique).
4. Confirm with **Create a Satellite.**
5. The platform will then create your Satellite and provision its resources.
6. Once the process is complete, click **Continue** to access the overview page.

🎉 You’re all set! You can now deploy your frontend app, static website, or publish your serverless functions to production.

➡️ Continue with the [deployment](/docs/category/deployment) guides to take the next step.
