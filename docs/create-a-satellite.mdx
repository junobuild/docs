# Create a Satellite

Before integrating Juno into your project, you need to create a [satellite].

1. To get started, sign-in to the Juno [console](https://console.juno.build). If you are a new developer on Juno and the Internet Computer, you may be prompted to create your first anonymous [Internet Identity].
2. Click **Launch a new satellite**.
3. Enter a name for your satellite (note: this is for display purposes only and does not need to be unique).
4. Confirm with **Create a Satellite.**
5. The platform will then create your satellite smart contract and provision its resources.
6. Once the process is complete, click **Continue** to access the overview page.
7. You are all set! Start Building now 🚀
