I'm excited to announce that Juno, the blockchainless platform for Web3 app development, is now open for all developers! That's right, no more waiting for an invitation code to start building your decentralized applications with Juno. We believe that decentralization should be accessible to everyone, and removing this barrier to entry is a crucial step towards achieving that goal.

With Juno, you can build and deploy Web3 apps with just frontend code, making it an easy and accessible choice for developers of all levels. Juno provides powerful tools and services for [authentication](/docs/build/authentication), simple [store for your data](/docs/build/datastore), [file storage](/docs/build/storage), and [hosting](/docs/build/hosting), so you can focus on building your app and not worry about the infrastructure.

Whether you're new to Web3 development or a seasoned pro, Juno's user-friendly platform makes it easy to build and deploy decentralized applications that can scale to meet the needs of your users. So why wait? [Sign up](https://console.juno.build) for Juno today and start building your next-generation Web3 app!
