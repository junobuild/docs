I’m thrilled to unveil the first big feature of the year: a brand-new way for Juno devs to monitor your wallet and modules automatically! 🚀

✅ Keeps cycles topped up when balances run low  
🔔 Sends email notifications for top-ups (opt-in)  
🔁 Set it up once, never again — it’s automatically applied to all future projects

Everything is controlled through the Mission Control — which means that developers remain the sole controllers!

The feature is built using the [Canfund](https://github.com/dfinity/canfund) library developed by the DFINITY Foundation. 12/10 would highly recommend it for building similar features.

This feature is part of an absolutely massive release. I believe there were over 270 commits shipped. 🤓

In this version, I also revised the navigation to integrate **Analytics, Monitoring, Mission Control, and Wallet** within the main panel. This update led to the introduction of new colors. 🎨
