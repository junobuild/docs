This new release brings a major upgrade to [Juno Analytics](https://juno.build) ‚Äî now powered by native HTTP requests with no more web workers or IndexedDB.

The JS client is now over 90% (üî•) smaller (just 3KB gzipped!), and the dashboard supports paginated views, top time zones, and OS metrics.

There are a few breaking changes (‚ÄºÔ∏è), so check the notes if you‚Äôre using analytics ‚Äî and make sure to upgrade your Orbiter and JS libraries at the same time ‚ö†Ô∏è.

Reach out if you have questions, happy to help!
