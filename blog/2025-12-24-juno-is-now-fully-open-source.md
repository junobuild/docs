Hey 👋

Juno is now fully open-source. No more AGPL. The project is now entirely released under the MIT license.

While all the tools were already licensed under MIT, the platform itself, a few crates, and the documentation were still released under AGPL. That worked well in the early days but can create friction for those who want to reuse Juno, or parts of it, in commercial projects or corporate environments. Plus, AGPL is not that cool, no? 😎

You can also consider this a small Christmas gift 🎁😉

Thank you to everyone who followed, tested, used, and supported Juno this year. I wish you a Merry Christmas and a fantastic New Year 2026.

Merry Christmas from Zürich 🎄<br />David
