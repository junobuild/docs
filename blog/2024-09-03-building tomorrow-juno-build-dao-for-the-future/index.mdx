Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹

I hope youâ€™re all doing well! Iâ€™m excited to share some big news with you today. Over the next few weeks, weâ€™re taking some significant steps toward shaping the future of Juno, and I wanted to keep you in the loop about whatâ€™s coming.

As you may know, Juno is a blockchain-as-a-service ecosystem that empowers developers to build decentralized apps efficiently. One of its strengths is that it gives developers full and sole control over their work. For this reason, it would be paradoxical to continue operating the platform with a centralized modelâ€”i.e., with me being the sole controller of services, such as the administration console or our CDN. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m thrilled to unveil that, in the upcoming weeks, Iâ€™m aiming to fix this bias by proposing that Juno becomes a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

While this potential shift is on the horizon, there are a few key steps you can take to stay informed and involved in the process. Hereâ€™s how you can help shape the future of developing on Web3:
