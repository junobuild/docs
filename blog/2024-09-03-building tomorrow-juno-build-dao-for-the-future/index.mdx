Hey everyone ðŸ‘‹

I hope youâ€™re all doing well! Iâ€™m excited to share some big news with you today. Over the next few weeks, weâ€™re taking some significant steps toward shaping the future of Juno, and I wanted to keep you in the loop about whatâ€™s coming.

As you may know, Juno is a blockchain-as-a-service ecosystem that empowers developers to build decentralized apps efficiently. One of its strengths is that it gives developers full and sole control over their work. For this reason, it would be paradoxical to continue operating the platform with a centralized modelâ€”i.e., with me being the sole controller of services, such as the administration console or our CDN. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m thrilled to unveil that, in the upcoming weeks, Iâ€™m aiming to fix this bias by proposing that Juno becomes a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO).

While this potential shift is on the horizon, there are a few key steps you can take to stay informed and involved in the process. Hereâ€™s how you can help shape the future of developing on Web3:

## 2. Get Informed

Iâ€™ve put together a white paper that outlines the reasoning and vision I have for a Juno Build DAO. I highly recommend giving it a read to fully understand what Iâ€™m aiming to achieve. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out on [Discord](https://discord.gg/wHZ57Z2RAG), [X](https://x.com/junobuild), or also the DFINITY forum (as requested per their guidelines).

Questions are always welcome at any time, but if youâ€™re looking to engage directly, Iâ€™ll be hosting a Juno Live session on 9 September at 3:00 PM CET. Join the livestream on [YouTube](https://youtube.com/live/jDmj8ypjoyM) to interact in real-time.

## 3. Cast Your Vote

While I typically avoid relying on third parties for core features, transforming Juno into a DAO without leveraging such services would be an immense task. Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m proposing to use the Internet Computerâ€™s built-in solution for creating and maintaining DAOs, known as [SNS](https://internetcomputer.org/how-it-works/sns/).

To kickstart the process of transforming our ecosystem, this framework requires submitting a proposal to the Internet Computerâ€™s governance, known as [NNS](https://internetcomputer.org/how-it-works/network-nervous-system-nns/). This step ensures a decentralized and democratic process. It also prepares for the handover of control of the smart contracts and allows all participants to review the parameters involved.

Once this proposal is live, your voice will be crucial! Youâ€™ll have the opportunity to vote on whether to accept or reject it.

Without your approval, the ICO wonâ€™t even start.
