I just shipped a release focuses solely on updates to the **Console UI**.

The main change is the addition of a new **Health Check** section under “Monitoring”, along with a clearer breakdown of memory metrics.

I also revisited the notion of the “auto-refill threshold”, as the previous description was misleading or partial.

Lastly, the step related to the “authentication domain” in the hosting wizard has been simplified.

All these changes are, of course, documented.

- [Domain based User Identity](https://juno.build/docs/build/authentication/#domain-based-user-identity)

Happy weekend ☀️
