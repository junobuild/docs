I had the opportunity to chat with [CÃ©dric](https://twitter.com/cediwaldburger) from [Code & State](https://www.codeandstate.com/) about [Juno](/).

During our conversation, we went through all of the features that Juno offers in-depth, and even built a form that we were able to deploy to production in just one hour.

It was great to share ideas with Code & State and see them share our excitement about launching Juno. Thanks for the engaging discussion!
