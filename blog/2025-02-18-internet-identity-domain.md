Morning! Great news for the Juno community, which has always used `identity.internetcomputer.org` as the default domain for authentication.

Internet Identity now supports passkeys on both of its domains!

This means it should no longer matters whether devs or users sign in via `identity.internetcomputer.org` or `identity.ic0.app` â€” the registered identity should work seamlessly across both. There are a few limitations, which is why II may prompt you to register your current device.

As a result, Iâ€™ve just launched a new, clean sign-in page with a single call to action! :rocket:

To address potential sign-in issues, the page still offers domain-specific methods as a fallback. Plus, I added a brand-new footer accessible on scrollâ€”kind of really happy with that design. :smiley:

Cool, cool, cool!
