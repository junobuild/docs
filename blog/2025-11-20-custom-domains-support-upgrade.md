Hey 👋

A new [release](https://github.com/junobuild/juno/releases/tag/v0.0.60) was shipped with two sweet improvements to the [Console](https://console.juno.build/).

## 🌐 Custom Domains New API

The hosting features for registering or administrating custom domains have been migrated to the API from the [DFINITY](https://dfinity.org/) Boundary Nodes team.

This migration makes managing domains:

- More reliable
- Significantly faster
- Future-proof

Massive kudos to the team delivering this capability - awesome work 💪

## ✨ UI Improvements

Alongside the domain upgrade, we shipped a few visual refinements:

Stronger contrast on cards and buttons for a cleaner, more readable interface (amazing what you can achieve by nudging brightness 😄)

The Launchpad has been slightly redesigned: "Create a new satellite" is now a primary button, bringing more clarity and guidance.
