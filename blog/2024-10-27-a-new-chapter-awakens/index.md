:::info TL;DR

I’ll be working 100% on Juno through 2025.

:::

Hey everyone 👋

As you may know, I recently proposed transforming Juno into a Decentralized Autonomous Organization through an SNS swap. Unfortunately, it didn’t reach its funding goal, so Juno didn’t become a DAO.

After the failure, three options came to mind: retrying the ICO with a lower target, continuing to hack as an indie project for a while, or simply killing it.

In the days that followed, I also received a few other options, including interest from venture capitalists for potential seed funding which wasn’t an option for me.

Then, something unexpected happened:

The [DFINITY](https://dfinity.org/) foundation’s CTO, [Jan Camendish](https://x.com/JanCamenisch), reached out and proposed an alternative: funding the project through 2025.

I took a few days to consider the offer and ultimately accepted.

This support is a tremendous vote of confidence in Juno’s potential and importance within the ecosystem.

It’s worth emphasizing that the foundation’s support comes with no strings attached. They do not receive any stake in Juno, have no preferential treatment, and will not influence decisions. Should I ever consider another SNS DAO or any other funding route in the future, the foundation would have no special allocation or shares. This remains _my project_, and I am the sole decision-maker and controller.

This support also strengthens the relationship between Juno and the foundation, allowing us to stay in close contact to discuss the roadmap. It’s an arrangement that respects autonomy while fostering collaboration to advance the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/). As they say, it takes two to tango.

This funding opens up a world of possibilities and marks the first time I’ll work 100% on a project I created. I’m thrilled to continue building Juno as a resource that makes decentralized development accessible and impactful for everyone.

Obviously, while Juno remains under my sole ownership for now, I still believe that Juno should eventually become a DAO. Promoting full control for developers while retaining centralized ownership would be paradoxical. When the time is right, a DAO will ensure that Juno’s growth, security, and transparency are upheld through community-driven governance.

Thank you to everyone who believed in Juno through the SNS campaign and beyond 🙏💙. Your support has been invaluable, and this new phase wouldn’t be possible without you. Here’s to what lies ahead—a new chapter indeed.

To infinity and beyond,
<br/>David
