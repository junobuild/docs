Hi 👋

A new release is out — `v0.0.56` 🚀

This release focuses on frontend changes in the Console:

- You can now label your Satellites with environment flags and tags. These appear in the launchpad, switcher, and overview. On the launchpad, they can also be used as search filters to quickly find the right Satellite.
- A new navigation feature – called “Spotlight” or “Quick Access” – lets you jump anywhere in the Console or run actions (such as changing the theme) in seconds. Open it with the search icon in the navbar or by pressing **Ctrl/Cmd + K**.

Hopefully these make building with the Console a little more fun (and faster)!
