Hi ğŸ‘‹

A new release v0.0.50 is out! ğŸš€

This one brings two improvements to the Analytics:

ğŸ“£ Campaign tracking is now supported! Just use standard UTM tags in your links â€” traffic sources like newsletters, ads, and social posts will show up directly in your dashboard. No extra setup needed.

```bash
# For example
https://myapp.com/?utm_source=newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_campaign=spring-launch
```

ğŸ¤– Bot detection has also been improved by using HTTP headers directly from the container smart contract (instead of those passed in the requests). More accurate and secure that way.

Enjoy! ğŸ§ªğŸ“Š
