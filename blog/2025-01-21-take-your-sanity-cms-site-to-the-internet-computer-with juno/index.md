The [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/) (ICP) provides decentralized hosting, meaning your site isn't tied to traditional cloud providers. Juno simplifies the process of deploying to the IC without needing to worry about the underlying blockchain details.

Some benefits include:

- Data ownership without compromise.
- Pay only for what you use.
- No infrastructure management.
