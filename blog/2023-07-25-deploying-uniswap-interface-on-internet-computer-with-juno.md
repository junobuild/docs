Hey Juno Community,

We are thrilled to bring you an incredible tutorial on how to deploy the [Uniswap](https://uniswap.org/) interface on the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/) using Juno! This exciting step transforms Uniswap into a fully decentralized application, with both the backend and frontend served directly from the blockchain.

In this video tutorial, [Moritz](https://twitter.com/cryptoschindler) from the [DFINITY Foundation](https://dfinity.org/) takes you through the seamless process of deploying from scratch to on-chain.

Watch the video below and unlock the boundless potential of building on Web3 with Juno:
