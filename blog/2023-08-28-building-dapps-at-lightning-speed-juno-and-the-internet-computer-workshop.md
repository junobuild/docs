Hey Juno Community,

I've recorded a tutorial that covers building dapps on the [Internet Computer](https://internetcomputer.org/) at lightning speed with [Juno](https://juno.build)!

In this workshop, you'll learn how easily you can implement authentication in your app, save data and images on the chain, and ultimately launch your first smart contract. And the best part? You won't need to write a single line of backend code.

So, grab a cup of coffee and join me on this exciting journey.
